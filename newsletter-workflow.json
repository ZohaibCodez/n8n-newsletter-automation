artificial intelligence—and new fears about the technology’s potential to trigger mass unemployment. CEOs predict [white collar “bloodbaths.”](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic) Headlines warn of [widespread job losses](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/sam-altman-predicts-ai-cause-102800375.html). With public anxiety growing, it can feel like the economy is already hemorrhaging jobs to AI. But what if, at least for now, the data are telling a different story?\n\nTo find out, we measured how the labor market has changed since ChatGPT’s launch in November 2022. Specifically, we analyzed the change in the occupational mix across the labor market over the past 33 months. If generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT were automating jobs at scale, we would expect to see fewer workers employed in jobs at greatest risk of automation.\n\nOur data found the opposite. In a [new report from the Budget Lab at Yale](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/evaluating-impact-ai-labor-market-current-state-affairs), we share our findings of a labor market characterized broadly by stability, rather than disruption, since ChatGPT’s release. Despite fears of an imminent AI jobs apocalypse, the overall labor market shows more continuity than immediate collapse. The percent of workers in jobs with high, medium, and low AI “exposure” has remained remarkably steady over time. (Jobs that are [highly “exposed” to generative AI technologies](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/generative-ai-the-american-worker-and-the-future-of-work/) have the highest percentage of tasks that ChatGPT can be used for to save significant time.)\n\nFigure 1\n\n*   [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Figure+1.+Change+in+the+proportion+of+workers+in+occupations+exposed+to+AI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-1-change-in-the-proportion-of-workers-in-occupations-exposed-to-ai%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-1-change-in-the-proportion-of-workers-in-occupations-exposed-to-ai%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+1.+Change+in+the+proportion+of+workers+in+occupations+exposed+to+AI)\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-1-change-in-the-proportion-of-workers-in-occupations-exposed-to-ai%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+1.+Change+in+the+proportion+of+workers+in+occupations+exposed+to+AI)\n*   [](https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Figure+1.+Change+in+the+proportion+of+workers+in+occupations+exposed+to+AI%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-1-change-in-the-proportion-of-workers-in-occupations-exposed-to-ai%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://threads.net/intent/post?text=Figure+1.+Change+in+the+proportion+of+workers+in+occupations+exposed+to+AI%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-1-change-in-the-proportion-of-workers-in-occupations-exposed-to-ai%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-1-change-in-the-proportion-of-workers-in-occupations-exposed-to-ai%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+1.+Change+in+the+proportion+of+workers+in+occupations+exposed+to+AI)\n*   [](mailto:?subject=https://www.brookings.edu:%20Figure%201.%20Change%20in%20the%20proportion%20of%20workers%20in%20occupations%20exposed%20to%20AI&body=Figure%201.%20Change%20in%20the%20proportion%20of%20workers%20in%20occupations%20exposed%20to%20AI%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-1-change-in-the-proportion-of-workers-in-occupations-exposed-to-ai%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n\n![Image 25: Change in the proportion of workers in occupations exposed to AI (Line chart)](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2hSH3/full.png)\n\nSimilarly, we looked at whether AI-displaced workers were visible in unemployment statistics. Again, we found no pattern of increasing AI exposure among the unemployed.\n\nThese findings do not suggest that AI hasn’t had any impact at all over the last three years. Our analysis complements and is consistent with [emerging evidence](https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Canaries_BrynjolfssonChandarChen.pdf)that AI may be contributing to unemployment among [early-career workers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-15/ai-replacing-entry-level-jobs-could-break-the-career-ladder). (It could also be consistent with evidence that a weakening labor market is hurting those same workers.) Our paper differs from more granular analyses that detect occupation-level impacts on isolated jobs or subpopulations—e.g., studying if writers or translators have lost jobs. There is still considerable uncertainty about AI’s early impact on these narrower sets of jobs and workers, which might be harbingers of wider labor market disruption in the future.\n\nFigure 2\n\n*   [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Figure+2.+Dissimilarity+in+the+occupational+mix+between+recent+college+graduates+%28Ages+20-24%29+and+older+college+graduates+%28Ages+25-34%29&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-2-dissimilarity-in-the-occupational-mix-between-recent-college-graduates-ages-20-24-and-older-college-graduates-ages-25-34%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-2-dissimilarity-in-the-occupational-mix-between-recent-college-graduates-ages-20-24-and-older-college-graduates-ages-25-34%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+2.+Dissimilarity+in+the+occupational+mix+between+recent+college+graduates+%28Ages+20-24%29+and+older+college+graduates+%28Ages+25-34%29)\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-2-dissimilarity-in-the-occupational-mix-between-recent-college-graduates-ages-20-24-and-older-college-graduates-ages-25-34%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+2.+Dissimilarity+in+the+occupational+mix+between+recent+college+graduates+%28Ages+20-24%29+and+older+college+graduates+%28Ages+25-34%29)\n*   [](https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Figure+2.+Dissimilarity+in+the+occupational+mix+between+recent+college+graduates+%28Ages+20-24%29+and+older+college+graduates+%28Ages+25-34%29%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-2-dissimilarity-in-the-occupational-mix-between-recent-college-graduates-ages-20-24-and-older-college-graduates-ages-25-34%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://threads.net/intent/post?text=Figure+2.+Dissimilarity+in+the+occupational+mix+between+recent+college+graduates+%28Ages+20-24%29+and+older+college+graduates+%28Ages+25-34%29%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-2-dissimilarity-in-the-occupational-mix-between-recent-college-graduates-ages-20-24-and-older-college-graduates-ages-25-34%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-2-dissimilarity-in-the-occupational-mix-between-recent-college-graduates-ages-20-24-and-older-college-graduates-ages-25-34%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+2.+Dissimilarity+in+the+occupational+mix+between+recent+college+graduates+%28Ages+20-24%29+and+older+college+graduates+%28Ages+25-34%29)\n*   [](mailto:?subject=https://www.brookings.edu:%20Figure%202.%20Dissimilarity%20in%20the%20occupational%20mix%20between%20recent%20college%20graduates%20%28Ages%2020-24%29%20and%20older%20college%20graduates%20%28Ages%2025-34%29&body=Figure%202.%20Dissimilarity%20in%20the%20occupational%20mix%20between%20recent%20college%20graduates%20%28Ages%2020-24%29%20and%20older%20college%20graduates%20%28Ages%2025-34%29%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-2-dissimilarity-in-the-occupational-mix-between-recent-college-graduates-ages-20-24-and-older-college-graduates-ages-25-34%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n\n![Image 27: Dissimilarity in the occupational mix between recent college graduates (Ages 20-24) and older college graduates (Ages 25-34) (Line chart)](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/g3qaI/full.png)\n\nOverall, our approach takes a broader lens and looks for economy-wide turbulence. Our methodology might miss the labor market equivalent of a small fire starting on the stove, but would clearly detect if the house was burning down.\n\nGenerative AI’s workplace impacts are comparable to earlier technological shifts\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese patterns might surprise those expecting rapid labor displacement due to AI. While the results contradict the most alarming headlines, they are strikingly consistent with past precedent. Even transformative technologies such as the computer and the internet took decades, not mere months, for their impacts to fully materialize in the workplace. That’s because technology adoption requires complementary investments, cultural shifts, and regulation.\n\nGenerative AI has followed a similar trajectory in its first few years. We compared the pace of occupational change since ChatGPT’s launch to similar periods of change following the introduction of computers and the internet. We found that the occupational mix has changed marginally faster during the early ChatGPT era compared to previous technological shifts. However, these changes predate ChatGPT’s launch, suggesting AI may not be the primary driver.\n\nFigure 3\n\n*   [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Figure+3.+Changes+in+the+occupational+mix+over+different+periods+of+technological+change&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-3-changes-in-the-occupational-mix-over-different-periods-of-technological-change%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-3-changes-in-the-occupational-mix-over-different-periods-of-technological-change%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+3.+Changes+in+the+occupational+mix+over+different+periods+of+technological+change)\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-3-changes-in-the-occupational-mix-over-different-periods-of-technological-change%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+3.+Changes+in+the+occupational+mix+over+different+periods+of+technological+change)\n*   [](https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Figure+3.+Changes+in+the+occupational+mix+over+different+periods+of+technological+change%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-3-changes-in-the-occupational-mix-over-different-periods-of-technological-change%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://threads.net/intent/post?text=Figure+3.+Changes+in+the+occupational+mix+over+different+periods+of+technological+change%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-3-changes-in-the-occupational-mix-over-different-periods-of-technological-change%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-3-changes-in-the-occupational-mix-over-different-periods-of-technological-change%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+3.+Changes+in+the+occupational+mix+over+different+periods+of+technological+change)\n*   [](mailto:?subject=https://www.brookings.edu:%20Figure%203.%20Changes%20in%20the%20occupational%20mix%20over%20different%20periods%20of%20technological%20change&body=Figure%203.%20Changes%20in%20the%20occupational%20mix%20over%20different%20periods%20of%20technological%20change%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-3-changes-in-the-occupational-mix-over-different-periods-of-technological-change%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n\n![Image 29: Changes in the occupational mix over different periods of technological change (Line chart)](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wMdAF/full.png)\n\nOverall, the pace of labor market change following ChatGPT’s launch nearly three years ago appears consistent with historical trends. AI’s early stages look less like a revolution and more like a familiar, gradual evolution. This suggests that the trajectory of AI more closely resembles Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor’s thesis of [“AI as normal technology,”](https://www.normaltech.ai/p/a-guide-to-understanding-ai-as-normal) rather than the more dramatic predictions of rapid takeoff that the [AI 2027 project](https://ai-2027.com/) and others have forecasted.\n\nWhy generative AI workplace adoption has been uneven\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy have AI’s workplace impacts so been so different than what was predicted? At first glance, generative AI seems better positioned for faster workplace diffusion than past technologies. In contrast to the incremental spread of computers, access to ChatGPT and other models such as Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Anthropic’s Claude feels instantaneous, more akin to social media diffusion. There are far fewer frictions in deployment: Access to cutting-edge generative AI models doesn’t require buying an expensive piece of hardware or installing cables, or for some users, even paying any money at all. When new generative AI capabilities are released, users can immediately access them, like the flip of a light switch.\n\nDespite this ubiquity and ease of access, actual workplace adoption to date has been highly uneven across sectors and occupations. The best data source for generative AI usage among workers comes from Anthropic, one of the leading AI labs. We compared Anthropic’s data on usage of its Claude chatbot with data on AI job exposure, and found little correlation between the two metrics. Our analysis revealed striking gaps between where AI could be useful (exposure) and where it is actually being used (Claude data).\n\nFigure 4\n\n*   [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Figure+4.+Gap+between+actual+and+expected+AI+usage+by+major+occupation&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-4-gap-between-actual-and-expected-ai-usage-by-major-occupation%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-4-gap-between-actual-and-expected-ai-usage-by-major-occupation%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+4.+Gap+between+actual+and+expected+AI+usage+by+major+occupation)\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-4-gap-between-actual-and-expected-ai-usage-by-major-occupation%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+4.+Gap+between+actual+and+expected+AI+usage+by+major+occupation)\n*   [](https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Figure+4.+Gap+between+actual+and+expected+AI+usage+by+major+occupation%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-4-gap-between-actual-and-expected-ai-usage-by-major-occupation%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://threads.net/intent/post?text=Figure+4.+Gap+between+actual+and+expected+AI+usage+by+major+occupation%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-4-gap-between-actual-and-expected-ai-usage-by-major-occupation%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n*   [](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-4-gap-between-actual-and-expected-ai-usage-by-major-occupation%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1&title=Figure+4.+Gap+between+actual+and+expected+AI+usage+by+major+occupation)\n*   [](mailto:?subject=https://www.brookings.edu:%20Figure%204.%20Gap%20between%20actual%20and%20expected%20AI%20usage%20by%20major%20occupation&body=Figure%204.%20Gap%20between%20actual%20and%20expected%20AI%20usage%20by%20major%20occupation%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ffigure-4-gap-between-actual-and-expected-ai-usage-by-major-occupation%2F%3Fr%3D1834497%26b%3D1)\n\n![Image 31: Gap between actual and expected AI usage by major occupation (Range Plot)](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pwQ6G/full.png)\n\nClaude chats were dominated by coding tasks, with writing tasks also overrepresented. This pattern reflects two realities: Claude’s specific reputation as particularly strong in those tasks, as well as those tasks’ ease of use across AI products. Recent [ChatGPT usage data from OpenAI](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/3c7f7e1b-36c4-446b-916c-11183e4266b7/chatgpt-usage-and-adoption-patterns-at-work.pdf) also tell a story of lagging and leading sectors, with information technology at the top and uneven usage across other sectors.\n\nThese patterns reveal the messy reality of workplace technology adoption. Generative AI workplace adoption has been constrained by a range of practical hurdles, from privacy and security concerns to liability risks, data availability, and governance challenges. These pain points vary in degree by sector: While software developers and freelance editors can quickly turn to AI tools with relative ease, professionals in highly regulated and risky sectors—such as law, finance, and medicine—are more constrained in their usage. Take radiology, a medical discipline that seems tailor-made for AI: While AI can already outperform doctors, [radiologists today are busier and better compensated](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-algorithm-will-see-you-now/) than ever. Across sectors, employers are now confronting the move from isolated pilots to large-scale adoption, requiring time- and resource-intensive change management.\n\nFuture labor market impacts may stem not only from wider adoption, but from different types of adoption. The early, low-hanging fruit of chatbot usage reflected in today’s data may not be the biggest risk to jobs. Indeed, much of this chatbot usage may reflect augmentation more than automation, with workers turning to chatbots and finding ways to improve their efficiency and performance.\n\nThe biggest risks may not come from chatbots speeding up tasks, but from firms re-engineering entire workflows to automate them. New [enterprise (i.e., business) usage data from Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report) illustrate this risk. While about half of Claude chatbot usage was for augmenting purposes, the overwhelming majority (77%) of the tasks that business clients using Claude’s API deployed were for the purpose of automation.\n\nWe need to be vigilant about monitoring AI’s ongoing impacts\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur data show stability, not disruption, in AI’s labor market impacts—for now. But that could change at any point. Generative AI may well join the ranks of transformative, general purpose technologies, but it is too soon to know how disruptive it will be, or at what pace. Without clear, timely analysis on AI’s impacts, we risk both overreacting to imagined crises and underreacting to real disruptions. Policymakers need evidence, not speculation, to steer the future of work.\n\nWhile our early findings are reassuring, the future requires vigilance. That’s why the [Budget Lab at Yale](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/) will monitor AI’s labor market impacts on a monthly basis. But vigilance requires better data. We need comprehensive usage information from all major AI companies at both the individual and enterprise level. Anthropic has set a precedent by releasing Claude usage data, including at the enterprise level, and OpenAI has shared summary statistics. But these offer only a partial view.\n\nTo truly understand AI’s trajectory, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and other leading AI labs should share usage data transparently and responsibly. Without this, policymakers, researchers, and the public will be flying blind into one of the most significant technological shifts of our time.\n\nAuthors\n\n[![Image 32: Molly Kinder](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Molly_Kinder_Metro.jpg?quality=75&w=250)](https://www.brookings.edu/people/molly-kinder/)\n\n[Molly Kinder](https://www.brookings.edu/people/molly-kinder/)Senior Fellow - [Brookings Metro](https://www.brookings.edu/programs/brookings-metro/)[@MollyKinder](https://twitter.com/MollyKinder)\n\n[![Image 33: Martha Gimbel headshot](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Martha-Gimbel-headshot.jpg?quality=75&w=333)](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-data-show-no-ai-jobs-apocalypse-for-now/)\n\nMartha Gimbel Executive Director - The Budget Lab at Yale\n\n[![Image 34: Joshua Kendall](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Joshua_Kendall_headshot-e1759335471417.jpg?quality=75&w=500)](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-data-show-no-ai-jobs-apocalypse-for-now/)\n\nJoshua Kendall Research Fellow - The Budget Lab at Yale\n\n[![Image 35: Maddie Lee, Research Assistant, The Budget Lab at Yale](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Lee-IMG_9615-e1759335500572.jpg?quality=75&w=500)](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-data-show-no-ai-jobs-apocalypse-for-now/)\n\nMaddie Lee Research Assistant - The Budget Lab at Yale\n\n**The Brookings Institution is committed to quality, independence, and impact.**We are supported by a [diverse array of funders](https://www.brookings.edu/about-us/annual-report/).

To ride the profitable and beneficial wave of AI adoption, however, having a roadmap is paramount.\n\n#### This article goes into detailed AI adoption statistics and real-world use cases by industry and task. It provides insights into how exactly you can use available AI opportunities and maximize the efficiency of your decision.\n\nContents\n--------\n\n[Global AI Market Overview](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#global-ai)\n\n[Business Growth Through AI](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#business-growth)\n\n[Custom AI Models: Accessible and Cost-Effective](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#custom-ai)\n\n[The Current State of AI Adoption](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#the-current-state)\n\n[AI Adoption Trends Across Key Industries](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#ai-adoption-trends)\n\n[Phases And Milestones In The AI Adoption Roadmap](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#phases-and-milestones)\n\n[AI Energy Dilemma](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#ai-energy)\n\n[Analyzing Job Exposure and Disruption Risks](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#analyzing-job)\n\n[Agentic AI](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#agentic-ai)\n\n[How AI Drives Business Transformation](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#digital-transformation)\n\n[Main AI Adoption Challenges](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#main-challenges)\n\n[Enter the AI Future with Confidence](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#enter-the-future)\n\nGlobal AI Market Overview\n-------------------------\n\nAnalysts project sustained global AI market growth, which is set to surpass [$240 billion](https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/artificial-intelligence/worldwide) in total value. AI adoption by the industry is growing by [up to 20%](https://clouddamcdnprodep.azureedge.net/gdc/gdcflXNT6/original) each year. In the 2023–2024 stretch alone, the use of generative AI jumped from 55% to 75%, with companies getting a 3.7x ROI for every buck they invest in GenAI and related technologies.\n\nThe leading adopters of AI solutions like IBM, Shopify, and Coca‑Cola have moved from using the technology for purely routine tasks to directly boosting employee productivity and speeding up top-line growth. AI-driven productivity tools remain the clearest path to commercial return.\n\n![Image 18: 2025 AI adoption stats by region and application](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/Bar%20Chart-1-3%20AI%20Trends%202025.png?width=5206&height=1701&name=Bar%20Chart-1-3%20AI%20Trends%202025.png)\n\nSource: [2024 Business Opportunity of AI](https://clouddamcdnprodep.azureedge.net/gdc/gdcflXNT6/original)\n\n### Business Growth Through AI\n\nThe AI adoption curve is still climbing, but how far it goes depends on whom you ask. Goldman Sachs [projects a 15% boost](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-may-start-to-boost-us-gdp-in-2027) to global GDP from AI over the next decade. J.P. Morgan is more restrained, expecting an [8% to 9% increase](https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/eur/en/insights/markets-and-investing/ideas-and-insights/how-ai-can-boost-productivity-and-jump-start-growth). Daron Acemoğlu, MIT economics professor,takes a much more cautious view of AI’s global economic impact, projecting only a [1–1.5% boost](https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/eur/en/insights/markets-and-investing/ideas-and-insights/how-ai-can-boost-productivity-and-jump-start-growth).\n\nWhat’s clear is that most value today comes from getting the basics right. You’re more likely to make AI work for your business if you design it with the intent to:\n\n*   Reduce operational costs\n\n*   Drive business growth\n\n*   Differentiate customer experience\n\n*   Ensure secure and reliable operations\n\nAccording to Max Belov, CTO at Coherent Solutions, [AI doesn't need to be revolutionary but must first be practical](https://www.techradar.com/pro/ai-with-a-human-touch-deploying-for-success). Too often, companies rush to adopt shiny new tools as part of transformation plans, only to discover they’ve overspent on systems without clear goals or an execution path.\n\n> ![Image 19: max-belov-cto-coherent-solutions](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Experts/max-belov-cto-coherent-solutions.jpg?width=375&height=375&name=max-belov-cto-coherent-solutions.jpg)\n> \n> \n> Max Belov, CTO at Coherent Solutions\n> \n> \n> for TechRadar Pro\n> \n> \n> _Organizations need to first sit down, establish realistic goals, and evaluate where AI can support their people and how it can be incorporated into their business objectives._\n\nYou should clarify who will use AI, at what scale, and how success will be measured to set the stage for real business growth. This will keep projects grounded and make the investment worthwhile.\n\n[](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025)\nCustom AI Models: Accessible and Cost-Effective\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe AI niche used to be very concept-driven back in the day, with investor-seeking designs, Proofs-of-Concept, ICOs, and crowdfunded campaigns reigning supreme.\n\nWe see real models bringing tangible results and respective profits to their owners and creators. For instance, [Accenture reports](https://cdn.luxe.digital/download/Accenture-AI-Industry-Growth-Full-Report-luxe-digital.pdf) that AI should bring a 35% productivity boost to the US labor sector by 2035 (as well as to other economies, 36% for Finland, 37% for Sweden, etc.).\n\nThe boundaries of AI adoption across industries expand even further due to an opportunity to take _clean slate_ AI models and tune them into whatever you need. Customizable AI is readily available today, which means you can save a ton of automation expenses without going far or going broke.\n\nThis is why a majority of organizations surveyed by Accenture plan to expand beyond pre-built AI solutions to customized or custom-built AI workloads, which brings us to another point.\n\n[](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025)\nThe Current State of AI Adoption\n--------------------------------\n\nAccording to global AI adoption studies by several sources:\n\nof firms [have employed AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai) by 2025 vs. 55% by 2024\n\nof companies look to [invest more in AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work)in 2025–2027\n\nof [tech budgets](https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/cio-playbook-global-study-roi-ai-adoption/#:~:text=IT%20leaders%20expect%20AI%20to,42%25%20in%20the%20coming%20year.) will be allocated to AI in 2025\n\nWithin the top 25% of AI spenders are healthcare, financial agencies and banks, media and telecom, manufacturing, and retail. Following those, energy and materials, consumer goods and ecommerce, hardware engineering, travel, transport, and logistics are all powered by AI to a certain extent.\n\n[](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025)\n### AI Adoption Trends Across Key Industries\n\nWe can typically see the highest [rates of AI adoption](https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_AI_in_Action_Beyond_Experimentation_to_Transform_Industry_2025.pdf) among the operations that must generate or digitize large sets of structured and unstructured data. The greater the data available, the more effectively AI models can be trained, refined, and scaled. So, this data focus works both ways.\n\n### IT and Telecom\n\nSymbiosis with AI is projected to potentially earn [$4.7 trillion in gross value](https://cdn.luxe.digital/download/Accenture-AI-Industry-Growth-Full-Report-luxe-digital.pdf) added for IT and telecom by 2035. This is a spacious niche where providers can develop and integrate AI platforms to run a range of internal, technical, and consumer services.\n\n![Image 20: Telecom global market capitalization by region](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/Donut%20Chart%20AI%20Trends%202025.png?width=3200&height=1940&name=Donut%20Chart%20AI%20Trends%202025.png)\n\nSource: [2025 Global Telecommunications Outlook](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-telecom-outlooks/telecommunications-industry-outlook-2025.html)\n\nWe can already witness the pioneers in these niches, like the AI-RAN Alliance, [launched](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20240227/carriers/ai-ran-alliance-kicks-off-integrate-ai-cellular-technology) back in February 2024. The AI-RAN Alliance gathers the top telecom and tech market leaders to focus efforts on merging AI with cellular technology. The ultimate goal of the alliance is to achieve new advancements in the RAN (radio access network) technology.\n\nOther use cases for AI adoption in IT and telecom:\n\n*   Network planning and optimization\n\n*   Network security\n\n*   CX enhancement\n\n*   Predictive maintenance\n\n*   Network slicing\n\n### Healthcare\n\nNumerous healthcare facilities and brands rely on the custom development of AI solutions. For example, custom AI tools enable safer and hyper-precise drug development and testing, highly detailed medical imaging, and automation of a ton of administrative work.\n\n![Image 21: Administrative tasks AI is used for](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/Bar%20Chart-1-1%20AI%20Trends%202025.png?width=3200&height=2160&name=Bar%20Chart-1-1%20AI%20Trends%202025.png)\n\nSource: [AI Adoption in Healthcare Report 2024](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/sqo8bpt9/production/68216fa5d161adebceb50b7add5b496138a78cdb.pdf)\n\nImportantly, the generative AI adoption rate is still only maturing in settings as complex and responsibility-driven as medicine. However, we can already see impressive implementations:\n\n*   At Coherent Solutions, we tapped into the creation of AI for healthcare with the[RX transcription tool for an eyewear manufacturer](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/case-studies/rx-transcription-tool-for-eyeglass-dispensing) company. This solution helps interpret optical prescriptions and select the right glasses.\n\n*   [Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopARdqa2T1lOYTaaI_p3cIyBcrBMHr3FaJClFg1f1V9NSdOMyW0) is a precision medicine platform that uses AI to analyze clinical data and personalize cancer care and other treatments.\n\n*   [PathAI](https://www.pathai.com/) uses deep learning to improve the accuracy of pathology diagnoses for faster, more precise treatments.\n\n*   The [NMDP Donor Readiness Score](https://nmdpbiotherapies.com/resources/the-role-of-ai-in-predicting-stem-cell-donor-availability/) helps predict individual stem cell donor availability.\n\nOther use cases for AI adoption in healthcare:\n\n*   Developing drugs\n\n*   Clinical documentation\n\n*   Clinical trials\n\n*   Medical imaging\n\nFinance and Banking\n\nThe productivity of knowledge workers, from accountants and managers to researchers and developers, can be boosted dramatically by automating mundane tasks. Like routine mortgage reviews, market inspection, answering generic customer queries, etc.\n\nAI tools, like innovative authentication systems, have also been developed to reinforce the security of access and interaction with valuable assets. At Coherent Solutions, we had the pleasure of building a [feature-rich identity authentication platform](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/case-studies/identity-authentication-platform) that restricts access based on real-time user behavior monitoring and analysis.\n\nIn dry figures, the financial sector can get up to $1.2 trillion extra GVA thanks to mass AI adoption in financial services in 2035. But that’s if the market players are not slowed down by the emerging [governance of AI adoption in central banks](https://www.bis.org/publ/othp90.pdf) and other [associated risks](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/2025-banking-financial-markets-outlook) too much.\n\nUse cases for AI adoption in banking and finance:\n\n*   Anomaly detection\n\n*   Payments\n\n*   Robo-advisors (portfolio management)\n\n*   Algorithmic trading\n\nManufacturing\n\nRobotics and IoT help accelerate AI adoption in manufacturing with intelligent systems that connect directly to construction sites and enable remote opportunities. [Accenture’s research](https://cdn.luxe.digital/download/Accenture-AI-Industry-Growth-Full-Report-luxe-digital.pdf) shows that AI could enrich the manufacturing sector with an extra $3.8 trillion GVA in 2035. But there are more promising stats.\n\n![Image 22: AI development status by sector and company size](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/Bar%20Chart-1-2%20AI%20Trends%202025.png?width=3200&height=4072&name=Bar%20Chart-1-2%20AI%20Trends%202025.png)\n\nSource: [Taking AI to the Next Level in Manufacturing](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/04/09/1090880/taking-ai-to-the-next-level-in-manufacturing/)\n\nThe [2025 State of AI in Manufacturing Survey](https://clouderp.rootstock.com/state-of-ai-manufacturing-survey-2025), which indicates that:\n\n*   More than 77% of manufacturers have implemented AI to some extent (as compared to 70% in 2023).\n\n*   AI in manufacturing is mostly employed in solutions for production (31%), customer service (28%), and inventory management (28%).\n\n*   Rather than fully autonomous AI bots, most manufacturing specialists (53%) would prefer working with collaborative bots or “copilots” (AI agents that support human workflows instead of fully replacing them).\n\n*   The leading investment niches for AI in manufacturing are supply chain management (49%) and big data analytics (43%).\n\n*   56% of manufacturers are still unsure whether their existing ERP systems are ready for full-on AI integration.\n\nUse cases fo r AI adoption in manufacturing:\n\n*   [Cobots](https://www.hanwha.com/newsroom/news/feature-stories/cobots-in-action-4-sectors-where-collaborative-robots-are-transforming-the-way-we-work.do)(collaborative robots)\n\n*   [Industry 4.0](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667241321000057)\n\n*   Generative design\n\n*   Quality assurance\n\n*   Predictive maintenance and demand forecasting\n\nRetail\n\nAccording to Deloitte’s [2025 US Retail Industry Outlook](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/retail-distribution/retail-distribution-industry-outlook.html), GenAI is really coming in handy in commerce. In particular, retailers saw 15% higher conversion rates after using chatbots during the Black Friday weekend.\n\n![Image 23: Wholesale and retail GVA in 2035](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/Column%20Chart-3%20AI%20Trends%202025.png?width=3200&height=2234&name=Column%20Chart-3%20AI%20Trends%202025.png)\n\nFurthermore, [IBM’s research](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/115d460037d51479) states that organizations working with retail and consumer products will be making the most extensive use of AI across 2025 and beyond. Solutions like Spokn AI have been developed to help ease global consumers’ widespread adoption of AI features.\n\n[Spokn AI](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/case-studies/ai-driven-speech-analytics-empowering-informed-business-decisions) is a tool for in-depth speech analytics in a contact center, which helps analyze sentiment and gain insights from customer conversations to find ways to improve their experience.\n\nOther use cases for AI adoption in retail:\n\n*   Hyper-personalized shopping\n\n*   Inventory management\n\n*   Fraud detection\n\n*   Voice and visual search\n\nPhases And Milestones In The AI Adoption Roadmap\n------------------------------------------------\n\nA [white paper by the World Economic Forum](https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Transforming_Consumer_Industries_in_the_Age_of_AI_2025.pdf)provides a breakdown of the stages companies typically follow to adopt AI. The last two stages are predicted to become the new normal in the near future:\n\n**Phase 1****Phase 2****Phase 3****Phase 4****Phase 5**\nLack of AI (or AI ban)Pilot AI adoption, experimentation Functional reinvention via AI Enterprise-level changes via AI Reinvention and boost of cross-industry processes\n_What we used to get_ _What we get today (2025)_ _What we’ll get in the near term_ _What we’ll get in midterm_ _What we’ll get in the long term (2029-2030)_\nRegulatory barriers, security risks, and other obstacles prevented companies from adopting AI reasonably.With real-world implementations gradually becoming a norm, companies actively experiment with AI, integrating it across new operational facets.Companies should get visible results and value from AI adoption, which can be measured, i.e., in respective profits.Companies should move on integrating now more mature AI solutions across more areas, including fundamental infrastructure, to a fuller extent.Continuous AI adoption should seep into more internal and external processes, offering value for entire chains of operations.\n\nYou’ll need more than typical steps to maximize AI’s efficiency and profitability.\n\nAs more businesses start using AI, a few big questions arise. How much energy do these systems use? How might they affect jobs and workplace safety? What does it really mean when AI starts making decisions on its own?\n\nMake AI work for your business.\n-------------------------------\n\nWe will help you pick the best AI integration scenario for your case.\n\n[Book a free consultation](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#contact-us)\n\n[](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025)\nAI Energy Dilemma\n-----------------\n\nThe autonomous performance of AI has a cost—energy. Depending on the task it handles, an AI model can consume [up to 500+ Wh](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00616-z) (watts/hour).\n\nOn top of that, enterprise- and industrial-scale AI solutions need to be powered by dedicated data centers. This must be why, [according to Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions.html#genai-power-consumption), AI operations can easily eat up to 40% of all power required to run a data center.\n\nCoherent Solutions’ ML Engineer, [Victoria Serghievici has shared](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/how-ai-businesses-can-reduce-their-carbon-footprint-emissions-data-centres) that:\n\n> ![Image 24: Victoria-Serghievici](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Victoria-Serghievici.jpg?width=800&height=600&name=Victoria-Serghievici.jpg)\n> \n> \n> Victoria Serghievici, Machine Learning Technical Lead and Group Manager at Coherent Solutions\n> \n> \n> for SiliconRepublic.com\n> \n> \n> _Data centers feeding AI with massive amounts of data are projected to consume about 3-4pc of the world’s electricity by 2026._\n\nVictoria also says that if data centers are about to start consuming around 1,189 TWh (4pc) each year, we are looking at 4x more electricity consumed than the entire country of the UK in a year.\n\nAI adopters should calculate their costs in-depth and balance out expenses, as well as measure the cost ratio of AI performance versus human specialist’s work. The latter may not always need to be replaced entirely.\n\n[](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025)\nAnalyzing Job Exposure and Disruption Risks\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAI continues to replace human talent in many types of workflows. As adoption scales, more jobs face disruption or even full replacement.\n\nAI solutions should affect [60 million](https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-09-15/artificial-intelligence-will-affect-60-million-us-and-mexican-jobs-within-the-year.html) US and Mexican jobs in just a year. Specifically, about 43 million (US) and 16 million (Mexico) jobs are highly exposed to AI within a one-year time horizon.\n\n![Image 25: Occupational Exposure in the U.S. Labor Market according to GENOE](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/Bar%20Chart-1-5%20AI%20Trends%202025.png?width=3566&height=3232&name=Bar%20Chart-1-5%20AI%20Trends%202025.png)\n\nSource: [Artificial intelligence will affect 60 million US and Mexican jobs within the year](https://archive.ph/Gulhj#selection-337.0-337.82)\n\nAccording to the index above, various iterations of AI will touch 980 million jobs worldwide, affecting about 26% of the global workforce in some way or another. Give it another five years, and that figure should grow to 38% and in 10 years to 44%.\n\n[](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025)\nAgentic AI\n----------\n\nAgentic AIs are advanced models that can run without human intervention while handling a range of complex, multistep tasks and reasoning problems. As such autonomous AIs improve, they could impact all known industries, both heavy and precise, from supply chain management and manufacturing/construction to medicine and education.\n\nMarking the [widespread focus on AI agents](https://clutch.co/resources/set-up-business-ai#get-ready-for-agentic-ai), Igor Epshteyn, President and CEO of Coherent Solutions, says:\n\n> ![Image 26: Igor Epshteyn CEO at Coherent Solutions](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/Igor%20Epshteyn%20CEO%20at%20Coherent%20Solutions.png?width=1600&height=1600&name=Igor%20Epshteyn%20CEO%20at%20Coherent%20Solutions.png)\n> \n> \n> Igor Epshteyn, President and CEO at Coherent Solutions\n> \n> \n> for Clutch\n> \n> \n> _2025 will mark a significant milestone_ _in AI agent adoption across industries such as finance, supply chain, sales, services, marketing, and tax… OpenAI’s_ _recent announcement_ _of the “Operator” framework and Amazon’s Bedrock Agents framework, which will enable companies to incorporate AI agents into their enterprise, highlights this trend._\n\nHowever, the main positions that such AIs can automate are those of knowledge workers (e.g., engineers, accountants, analysts, etc.). There are more than 100 million knowledge workers based in the US and over 1.25 billion globally. Today’s most relevant [Agentic AI use cases](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2025/autonomous-generative-ai-agents-still-under-development.html#promising-use) have already started replacing them in aspects such as:\n\n*   Customer support\n\nAI agents handle customer inquiries that regular support chatbots cannot, including complex issue resolution, like providing personalized step-by-step instructions. They can also analyze calls and interactions to help boost customer satisfaction.\n\n*   Cybersecurity\n\nAgentic cybersecurity systems help detect attacks autonomously, they generate reports that help pinpoint flaws and improve security, and automate [up to 90%](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2025/autonomous-generative-ai-agents-still-under-development.html#promising-use) of other human expert’s workload.\n\n*   Regulatory compliance\n\nEmerging agentic AIs can analyze corporate documents and regulations, providing fast and precise compliance checks for companies and startups in industries from finance to healthcare.\n\n*   Agent builders and orchestrators\n\nA number of startups gradually introduce tools and platforms for setting up custom multi-agentic systems that can be tuned for any purpose. These include the Google Vertex no-code tool for creating individual agents and LangChain for multi-agentic solutions.\n\n**The right AI solution starts with the right conversation**.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTurn to our AI software engineering specialists to get results on time and on budget.\n\n[Book a free consultation](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025#contact-us)\n\n[](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025)\nHow AI Drives Business Transformation\n-------------------------------------\n\nBusinesses of all scales, as well as startups, initiatives, and projects of any purpose, leverage AI to reinvent and upgrade the usual and outdated processes. Whether it’s a project for small-to-medium business or an enterprise AI adoption cycle, companies and startups of all scales can use AI capacities for:\n\n*   **Customer service chatbots and agents**. A lot of burden can be relieved from human support agents with virtual assistants that handle routine (or more complex) customer queries and inputs.\n*   **Predictive analytics to forecast demand**. Specialized AI models dig into historical sales data, seasonal dynamics, and market trends to forecast a service’s or product’s demand.\n*   **Predictive maintenance**. Connected to hardware or vehicles, AI-based systems for maintenance can track equipment performance in real time, pinpoint anomalies, and predict accidents or failures.\n\nStill, many [AI adopters looking to digitize workflows](https://digitalisationworld.com/blogs/57938/how-to-make-digital-transformation-efforts-a-success#:~:text=How%20Do%20Businesses%20Use%20AI%20to%20Transform%3F) or other processes fail to achieve success with their intentions, mostly due to misplacing AI tools or rushing to adopt them without researching their applications first.\n\n> ![Image 27: Igor Epshteyn CEO at Coherent Solutions](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/Igor%20Epshteyn%20CEO%20at%20Coherent%20Solutions.png?width=1600&height=1600&name=Igor%20Epshteyn%20CEO%20at%20Coherent%20Solutions.png)\n> \n> \n> Igor Epshteyn, President and CEO at Coherent Solutions\n> \n> \n> for Digitalisation World\n> \n> \n> _Less than 30% of tech businesses succeed with digital transformation strategies.

Opinions expressed are those of the author.\n\n | Membership (fee-based)\n\nApr 19, 2024, 01:15pm EDT\nApr 23, 2024, 03:10pm EDT\n\nAs organizations explore ways to harness artificial intelligence, including the large language models that power generative AI, it’s essential to be prepared for both “misfires” and security risks. AI tools’ capacity for bias and returning false or misleading information (a.k.a. “hallucinating”) necessitates careful training and prompting. Further, enterprise AI use cases often rely on interfacing with essential systems and accessing sensitive data, so robust security controls are critical.\n\nIt’s important to be ever-mindful that no model is flawless and that multiple security vulnerabilities can come with the many benefits. Below, 20 members of [Forbes Technology Council](https://councils.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil \"https://councils.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil\") share tips to help organizations account for the abilities, limitations and security challenges of AI.\n\n## 1. Prioritize Preventing Data Leaks And Attacks\n\nTo protect AI models, prioritize a strategy to prevent data leaks and adversarial attacks, incorporating strong data governance, anonymization, encryption and strict access controls. Include adversarial resilience training and model monitoring and integrate security throughout the AI lifecycle. Utilize explainable AI for enhanced transparency and manipulation detection. - [Jennifer Gold](https://councils.forbes.com/u/b0c0ef8a-c09b-4f95-bad2-09fef0f0caaf \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/b0c0ef8a-c09b-4f95-bad2-09fef0f0caaf\"), [Apollo Information Systems](https://apollo-is.com/ \"https://apollo-is.com/\")\n\n## 2. Protect Your APIs\n\nAI models that have access to APIs and integrations are vulnerable to attack vectors. A recent research paper details how LLMs with APIs have been used to propagate worms. You can limit the impact of such attacks by making sure your APIs are scoped to a minimum dataset. Don’t use admin or super user APIs, and put additional safety checks in place on any APIs that are accessible by LLMs. - [M. Nash](https://councils.forbes.com/u/d08fc796-527c-47e6-a7f8-09204fca70f1 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/d08fc796-527c-47e6-a7f8-09204fca70f1\"), [Integry](https://www.integry.ai/ \"https://www.integry.ai/\")\n\n---\n\n[Forbes Technology Council](https://councils.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil?utm_source=forbes.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=forbes-links&utm_content=in-article-ad-links \"https://councils.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil?utm_source=forbes.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=forbes-links&utm_content=in-article-ad-links\") is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Secure The AI Supply Chain\n\nBusinesses must secure their AI supply chain to ensure AI is being delivered safely and securely. Organizations today do not have the ability to see, know and manage AI systems to identify security risks, deploy safer applications and be more resilient to attacks. Adopting a secure-by-design approach to AI can help businesses protect themselves from unique AI supply chain vulnerabilities. - [Ian Swanson](https://councils.forbes.com/u/3dd719ed-4028-4fb4-8c26-0dde8d11d809 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/3dd719ed-4028-4fb4-8c26-0dde8d11d809\"), [Protect AI](https://protectai.com/ \"https://protectai.com/\")\n\n## 4. Ensure Confidential Data Isn’t Exposed\n\nIt’s crucial to ensure generative AI models do not inadvertently expose or reveal confidential data used during training or prompting. Data governance protocols such as encryption, anonymization and access controls can protect data and maintain compliance. Monitoring and auditing AI system activities can also prevent security breaches, ensuring confidentiality and the integrity of data in the AI life cycle. - [Asif Hasan](https://councils.forbes.com/u/2d7b3b51-0a39-4d1c-8146-b2ff3ae4e3c0 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/2d7b3b51-0a39-4d1c-8146-b2ff3ae4e3c0\"), [Quantiphi](https://quantiphi.com/ \"https://quantiphi.com/\")\n\n## 5. Be Wary Of Input Injection Attacks And Output Manipulation\n\nIf the adoption of enterprise AI and GenAI tools such as ChatGPT also includes data input or data training by the organization—such as customization for customer-use cases—then input injection attacks and manipulation of outputs could be a concern. This is similar to boundary condition manipulation in any computer-based system, which is used to achieve false output. - [Ondrej Krehel](https://councils.forbes.com/u/2c05fe79-ce44-4261-a6ee-2d1ac2567dd1 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/2c05fe79-ce44-4261-a6ee-2d1ac2567dd1\")\n\n## 6. Think Through The Consequences Of Model Hallucinations\n\nDepending on the use cases where a tool such as ChatGPT is going to be applied, there are two types of concerns. The first is the ways the outputs of a technology such as ChatGPT can impact the business. For example, what are the impacts and consequences in the event the model hallucinates or wrongly represents the business brand? The second is the potential exposure of sensitive information (whether business or personal). - [Fabiana Clemente](https://councils.forbes.com/u/203e6cdc-2857-45ca-b618-61a9cae681ed \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/203e6cdc-2857-45ca-b618-61a9cae681ed\"), [YData](https://ydata.ai/ \"https://ydata.ai/\")\n\n## 7. Be Cognizant Of Copyright Concerns\n\nBusinesses venturing into enterprise AI must navigate copyright concerns, a challenge even for giants such as Google. This happens when AI systems utilize content without proper authorization, potentially resulting in outputs that closely mirror someone else’s original work. To prevent this, companies must adhere to copyright laws and ensure their AI systems are trained on noninfringing data sources. - [Gabriel Lopez](https://councils.forbes.com/u/48871cd6-db96-4336-b9da-fffe78bfdbf4 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/48871cd6-db96-4336-b9da-fffe78bfdbf4\"), [Orange Loops](http://orangeloops.com \"http://orangeloops.com\")\n\n## 8. Establish Precise Rules For Providing Corporate Data To Free Tools\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that the operators of free AI tools are provided with data that users voluntarily give them. Therefore, it is important to establish precise rules for providing corporate data to free tools. The situation is different if a company uses an AI product developed specifically for its needs; in this case, precise conditions for the use of the data can be agreed upon with the supplier. - [Filip Dvorak](https://councils.forbes.com/u/099912a8-b95a-4345-a006-b4f2757f4706 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/099912a8-b95a-4345-a006-b4f2757f4706\"), [Filuta AI](http://filuta.ai/ \"http://filuta.ai/\")\n\n## 9. Understand The Information Customer-Facing Chatbots May Expose\n\nGuard your brand’s reputation. By their very nature, LLMs in their current architecture will always hallucinate. You can try to limit it by fine-tuning and retraining, adjusting and adding guardrails, but there is only so much you can do. Businesses should take this into account, especially when exposing solutions to external customers. If prompted correctly, chatbots will lie, promote competitor solutions, misbehave and so on. - [Pawel Rzeszucinski](https://councils.forbes.com/u/3001b5da-411b-42a6-a0e1-3932e7aeef68 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/3001b5da-411b-42a6-a0e1-3932e7aeef68\"), [Team Internet Group PLC](https://teaminternet.com/ \"https://teaminternet.com/\")\n\n## 10. Confirm Your AI Partners Are Ethical\n\nAs the founder of a generative music startup working with large brands, I can tell you that procurement and legal teams are all over the copyright implications. No one wants to get sued for AI-related infringement, whether it’s in marketing content or elsewhere. Executives should make sure their AI partners are ethical, properly licensing or owning all training data and subsequent outputs. - [Antony Demekhin](https://councils.forbes.com/u/a8c59712-72c9-4f74-984c-17d6f48c55f2 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/a8c59712-72c9-4f74-984c-17d6f48c55f2\"), [Tuney](http://www.tuney.io \"http://www.tuney.io\")\n\n## 11. Guard Against AI Model Poisoning\n\nThe risk of AI model poisoning, which refers to the intentional manipulation of a model’s training data or learning process to reinforce one’s hypothesis or display biased behavior, should be a security concern. This could lead to suboptimal decisions, unintended discrimination against some user groups, and/or the exposure of sensitive information, resulting in violation of security protocols. - [Amit Jain](https://councils.forbes.com/u/ab7aa782-ce99-48f0-9965-93626372bef8 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/ab7aa782-ce99-48f0-9965-93626372bef8\"), [Roadz](https://roadz.com/ \"https://roadz.com/\")\n\n## 12. Safeguard The AI Models Themselves\n\nA business should consider safeguarding the AI models themselves, which can be targeted by adversaries to extract sensitive information or manipulate their behavior. To maintain security and enforce privacy programmatically, a business might employ techniques such as model encryption, differential privacy and federated learning. - [Lindsey Witmer Collins](https://councils.forbes.com/u/20061abc-c631-4470-abad-f089309f5bc9 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/20061abc-c631-4470-abad-f089309f5bc9\"), [WLCM “Welcome” App Studio](https://wlcm.studio \"https://wlcm.studio\")\n\n## 13. Know Where The Model Is Hosted And Who Can Access It\n\nAsk yourself, “Where is the model being hosted, and who has access to it?” Several customers have asked us to rewrite our existing OpenAI functionality (which uses OpenAI’s API directly) to use the Microsoft Azure OpenAI platform instead. This allows them to keep all of their data inside their secure Azure infrastructure versus going over the public internet. - [Adam Sandman](https://councils.forbes.com/u/da6029f2-1e76-407e-bfb9-e4179d6b3b9e \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/da6029f2-1e76-407e-bfb9-e4179d6b3b9e\"), [Inflectra Corporation](https://www.inflectra.com \"https://www.inflectra.com\")\n\n## 14. Moderate GenAI-Created Content Closely\n\nGenerative AI enables the creation of new and unique content, which can be an image, text or video. Content moderation is a key requirement to make sure the application does not output illegal, inappropriate or otherwise undesirable content. This will help a company avoid lawsuits that could arise from such content being used for unwanted or inappropriate purposes. - [Vishwas Manral](https://councils.forbes.com/u/9da4e404-528d-4806-943c-736ed65c5b2a \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/9da4e404-528d-4806-943c-736ed65c5b2a\"), [Precize Inc](http://precize.io \"http://precize.io\").\n\n## 15. Be Prepared To Counter Jailbreaking Attempts\n\nWhile data security is a concern while AI models are being built, there is a greater concern businesses should account for: jailbreaking. This entails bypassing restrictions to gain greater control and tricking an LLM into ignoring safety protocols or the content filters designed to prevent harmful responses. - [Ankit Virmani](https://councils.forbes.com/u/0f805f7e-6ce5-4bf9-9f9b-933e6817181e \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/0f805f7e-6ce5-4bf9-9f9b-933e6817181e\"), [Google Inc.](https://www.google.com/ \"https://www.google.com/\")\n\n## 16. Plan A Process For Filtering And Sanitizing Inputs\n\nAdversaries will try to manipulate AI-driven systems with injection-like attacks, embedding malicious instructions in legitimate user inputs. Since AI language models work within natural conversations, distinguishing data from syntax is more challenging than in a more familiar structured query language injection. Plan an adaptive process for filtering and sanitizing inputs to enhance security. - [Ilia Sotnikov](https://councils.forbes.com/u/268baa42-c826-4fdc-9ec2-33814d69e737 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/268baa42-c826-4fdc-9ec2-33814d69e737\"), [Netwrix](https://www.netwrix.com/ \"https://www.netwrix.com/\")\n\n## 17. Establish Employee Training On Using AI Models\n\nRevealing intellectual property and having generative AI “learn” your trade secrets should be top of mind when implementing AI models. Training employees on usage and protecting sensitive IP will always revolve around social engineering and proper employee adherence. Today, there’s little training on how to use AI and what it could do with the data given to it during the course of a session. - [Tom Roberto](https://councils.forbes.com/u/32b0d80d-e43d-4eff-a20b-6a9765632178 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/32b0d80d-e43d-4eff-a20b-6a9765632178\"), [SG Network Services](https://www.sgnetservice.com \"https://www.sgnetservice.com\")\n\n## 18. Comply With Applicable Regulations\n\nData privacy, security and confidentiality are paramount, especially for global organizations. Compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act is crucial to maintaining customers’ trust (the intensity of concern varies by industry and applicable regulations). Enterprise AI and GenAI models heavily rely on provided data, emphasizing the need for tailored governance and controls to meet an organization’s unique needs. - [Geetha Kommepalli](https://councils.forbes.com/u/2f75a567-0f71-4428-8f9d-e35ba59bd49f \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/2f75a567-0f71-4428-8f9d-e35ba59bd49f\"), [Skillsoft](http://www.skillsoft.com/ \"http://www.skillsoft.com/\")\n\n## 19. Test Response Accuracy Thoroughly\n\nTo reduce liability risks from AI “hallucinations,” test AI response accuracy thoroughly. Use layered validation checks, feedback loops for model refinement and version control for safe rollbacks. Use simulated real-world scenarios, bias and sensitivity analyses, and third-party audits to assess model accuracy. These measures ensure AI-generated responses are accurate, reducing misinformation. - [Ravi Soni](https://councils.forbes.com/u/ff92ea1d-77a4-4397-94df-726ba7ffabcf \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/ff92ea1d-77a4-4397-94df-726ba7ffabcf\"), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/ \"https://aws.amazon.com/\")\n\n## 20. Track The Metadata Regarding GenAI’s Usage\n\nIf you use LLMs such as ChatGPT in business processes, tracking the metadata regarding where generative AI has been used is important. Most organizations aren’t using ChatGPT in a well-defined way; individuals are using it without oversight or acknowledging that they’re doing it. If we plan on adopting this new technology—and we should—we have to be transparent about when and how it’s being used. - [Lewis Wynne-Jones](https://councils.forbes.com/u/f8c4f569-abff-483d-b751-1173945ea4c8 \"https://councils.forbes.com/u/f8c4f569-abff-483d-b751-1173945ea4c8\"), [ThinkData Works](https://www.thinkdataworks.com/ \"https://www.thinkdataworks.com/\")\n\n[Editorial Standards](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/forbes-editorial-values-and-standards/)\n[Reprints & Permissions](https://www.parsintl.com/publications/forbes/)\n\nBy[Expert Panel®](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/people/expertpanel/ \"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/people/expertpanel/\")\n\nCOUNCIL POST | Membership (fee-based)\n\nSuccessful CIOs, CTOs & executives from [Forbes Technology Council](https://councils.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil \"https://councils.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil\") offer firsthand insights on tech & business.\n\nVisit [Expert's](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/people/expertpanel/) [website](https://councils.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil).\n\nLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...\nFORBES’ FEATURED Video"

It's no longer science fiction anymore!\n\nLots of AI tools can serve as our own personal assistants -- answering questions, helping us write text, create images, speak more effectively, and more.\n\nTime has always been a barrier in the classroom. Most teachers would agree that they would be able to do more -- including the things that are most important -- if they had more time.\n\nTeachers can find AI tools that are ready to help them out right now. Lots of them are free or have \"freemium\" plans with limited free options.\n\nBelow is a description of AI and how you can start using it to support your work in class.\n\n## What is artificial intelligence?\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a computer or machine to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and more. There are several different approaches to building AI systems, including machine learning, where a system is trained on a dataset and can improve its performance over time, and rule-based systems, where the system follows a set of predetermined rules to make decisions.\n\nAI can be applied to a wide range of areas, including natural language processing, image and video recognition and robotics. The goal of AI research is to create systems that can perform tasks at least as well as, or ideally better than, humans. AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries and transform the way we live and work, but it also raises important ethical and social questions.\n\n## 40 AI tools for the classroom\n\nWe have gathered 40 of our favorite AI tools for teachers to be used in the classroom below.

I want to ensure that any tools I try respect the privacy of my students’ information, and some of these seem like they might not be, since they are not specifically designed for education.\n- Lara says:\n\n  [August 11, 2024 at 7:39 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/131571)\n\n  This AI is realy cool! Thank you for suggestion. I have used the image generator and the pictures turned out high quality and believable.\n- Jay says:\n\n  [June 12, 2024 at 7:36 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/131430)\n\n  I also really like Socrat.ai! They have some cool in-classroom chatbots that you can design if you want a unique assignment idea for your students.\n- Nelly says:\n\n  [June 8, 2024 at 5:52 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/131428)\n\n  Thanks for the list! I’ll also add one more tool that will be useful – <https://copyfrog.ai/>\n- Laila Khalil says:\n\n  [May 13, 2024 at 2:52 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/131332)\n\n  This article is really helpful. Even the comments are great because they give more information about AI tools.\n- Robert Jones says:\n\n  [May 7, 2024 at 8:08 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/131309)\n\n  Brisk Teaching is spot-on for this. It’s great to see tools like briskteaching.com getting recognition in AI education discussions. Keep it up!\n- Chris says:\n\n  [April 30, 2024 at 11:07 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/131295)\n\n  Hi, I need something that can create work booklets based on a word version of a revision guide with little quizzes, questions and a range of different tasks built in.\n- [Debbie](http://Www.epiccharterschools.org) says:\n\n  [April 19, 2024 at 3:37 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/131269)\n\n  I love love all your sources but I need an AI just to sort, reference and organize everything you have on your site. Speaking of which I know I saw an Ai that would automatically generate a google form, didn’t I? Or was I dreaming?\n- Wendy says:\n\n  [April 12, 2024 at 11:15 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/131248)\n\n  Excellent AI collection.\n- Caitlin L says:\n\n  [February 29, 2024 at 12:27 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/131137)\n\n  Hi Sharon,Teachaid.ca is a new AI tool in development. I’ve met with the founder, Nadeem Aljaber at least twice now and they are super open to feedback. With their AI tools you can generate full unit and lesson plans, assessments, vocabulary words, generates lesson activities and you can even generate differentiated activities too. They are always open to feedback.\n- Sharon says:\n\n  [February 9, 2024 at 4:40 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/131041)\n\n  Is there an AI that generates plans, presentations and quizzes? Rather than using different AI’s for each. I teach young children so this would be a game changer for me! I could spend more time supporting them and less time making visual teaching props.\n- [Matt Miller](https://ditchthattextbook.com) says:\n\n  [January 25, 2024 at 5:52 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/130962)\n\n  Funny you mention that … I met Suvi from Brisk two days ago at a conference. I didn’t know about it, but I know about it now. And two teachers in a session I led said that they used it. Don’t be surprised if it makes the list during our next update. Thanks for sharing about it.\n- Marcus Steiner says:\n\n  [January 25, 2024 at 2:25 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/130959)\n\n  honestly I’m very surprised that briskteaching.com isn’t on the list. I was a fan of magicSchool AI but a colleague shared brisk with me and it has become my school’s go to.\n\n  The feedback comments alone save me at least 10 hours a week\n- Jonathan Libov says:\n\n  [December 21, 2023 at 12:37 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/130849)\n\n  Sorcerer (<https://antimatter.systems/sorcerer>) is one to keep an eye on. Eric Curts’ just wrote about it today in Control + Alt + Achieve: <https://www.controlaltachieve.com/2023/12/edtech-cool-tool-sorcerer.html>\n- REENU PAUL says:\n\n  [November 29, 2023 at 4:51 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/130750)\n\n  NO WORDS TO EXPLAIN .Thanks for taking time to create a helpful and informative article also for sharing us this unique content\n- Claudia says:\n\n  [August 10, 2023 at 12:00 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/130266)\n\n  thank you for sharing. I learnt so much, I can’t wait to try using some of these AIs and other teaching tools.\n- April says:\n\n  [August 3, 2023 at 3:32 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/130244)\n\n  Eduaide.ai is also a good resource along with MagicSchool.\n- [mehir](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools) says:\n\n  [July 20, 2023 at 5:28 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/130146)\n\n  Thank you very much for sharing these great resources\n- Silvia Jones says:\n\n  [July 10, 2023 at 1:08 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/130100)\n\n  Great resource! I use <https://learnt.ai> mainly – primarily for reports, activity ideas and there is a lesson planner chat bot thing that is pretty good. Thanks for the other recommendations!\n- Yvonne Tam says:\n\n  [June 23, 2023 at 5:35 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129991)\n\n  Good to know!\n- Yvonne Tam says:\n\n  [June 23, 2023 at 5:34 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129990)\n\n  Thanks for the information. I am a new to AI but definitely will try them out.\n- Yvonne Tam says:\n\n  [June 23, 2023 at 5:33 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129989)\n\n  I totally agreed! It will be a great help in preparing lessons ahead!\n- Yvonne Tam says:\n\n  [June 23, 2023 at 5:32 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129988)\n\n  I love all the suggested AI. Over the years, a teacher has to create and seek for resources to enhance their teaching. Not to mention, the students expectations are far more different than years ago. Some of AI are even free to apply and incorporate in our classroom. These AIs definitely help students engage and motivate. Thanks for all these wonderful AIs.\n- [Adeel Khan](http://www.magicschool.ai) says:\n\n  [June 18, 2023 at 8:27 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129956)\n\n  Magicschool.ai is a great tool to add to this list. It can help lesson plan, differentiate, write assessments, write IEPs, communicate clearly, and more.\n- Kevin Kaeser says:\n\n  [June 5, 2023 at 5:59 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129890)\n\n  Thanks for Sharing, what a cool tool!\n- Gail Anne Ruckel says:\n\n  [May 2, 2023 at 1:48 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129691)\n\n  Thank you the amount of information is toooo much thank you\n- [Artur](https://mayai.org) says:\n\n  [April 20, 2023 at 6:05 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129640)\n\n  My favorite tool is MayAI.org\n- Natalie says:\n\n  [March 28, 2023 at 11:39 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129539)\n\n  You should include briskteaching.com\n\n  It saves me hours a week\n- [Hannah Jackson](http://teacherbot.io) says:\n\n  [March 21, 2023 at 4:39 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129502)\n\n  You should include Teacherbot. In my view, the most innovative approach to using AI for teachers and planning.\n- Indranil Mitra says:\n\n  [March 2, 2023 at 11:03 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129388)\n\n  Simply awesome!\n- [Ben G](https://bengooderham.com) says:\n\n  [February 23, 2023 at 7:04 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129331)\n\n  Totally agree. Twee is great!\n- Rob says:\n\n  [February 23, 2023 at 6:52 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129330)\n\n  Speachify is no longer free. It has a free 3 day trial.\n- Sarah P says:\n\n  [February 22, 2023 at 2:31 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129328)\n\n  I love ChatGPT! But I think Twee is much more convenient for a busy teacher cuz you don’t need to try many different requests to get the desired result. You can just pick a tool, type in a topic and that’s it, the task is ready 🤯That’s so simple!\n- Bob Clark says:\n\n  [February 22, 2023 at 1:35 pm](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129327)\n\n  Matt, you continue to amaze me. I will be first in line for your new book. That said, if you ever need someone to be a guinea pig for some of these sites to give you feedback, feel free to ask as I am really enjoying experimenting with AI. I also would like to second what Angie said about twee.com it has some really good tools for teachers.\n- Angie says:\n\n  [February 21, 2023 at 7:52 am](https://ditchthattextbook.com/ai-tools/#comments/129296)\n\n  This article is really awesome! Here’s another AI platform for teachers twee.com. Did you see it before? I’m an ESL teacher and use it to prepare for my lessons.\n\n**Session expired**\n\n[Please log in again.](https://ditchthattextbook.com/wp-login.php) The login page will open in a new tab.

this list\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIn this article I list 45 AI tools across 21 different categories. After exploring all the available options in each category, I’ve carefully selected the best tools based on my personal experience. This ensures that the recommendations come from real, practical use, so you can trust that they’re grounded in what actually works.\n\nFor each tool, I focus on its best use cases, explaining when and how it can be most useful. I also share what I love about each one, as well as any downsides I’ve encountered during my experience. Additionally, I provide information on the free version and premium pricing plans for each tool.\n\nFree AI tools\n-------------\n\nIf you're looking for free AI tools, you're in luck! I made sure that every AI tool listed in this article offers either a free plan or free trial with no credit card required, allowing you to explore their features and functionality without any commitment.\n\nThe best AI assistants\n----------------------\n\n### [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nBy now, everyone’s heard of ChatGPT. Most of us use it daily for a wide range of personal and professional tasks.\n\nIt’s still my go-to AI assistant, even though the alternatives on this list are now much stronger contenders than when ChatGPT first launched.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the ability to upload and analyze files. At work, I regularly drop in PDFs, spreadsheets, screenshots—you name it—and ask ChatGPT to summarize, analyze, or extract data. Just recently, I uploaded a screenshot of a funnel analysis in Google Analytics, and it gave me genuinely useful insights into where we might be losing users. Pretty irresistible stuff.\n\nI also used it to analyze a bunch of spreadsheets for [this post](https://www.synthesia.io/post/state-of-instructional-design-survey). I uploaded the raw survey data and got back clear trends, key insights, and even recommendations for the best chart types to visualize them. It literally saved me hours.\n\nChatGPT is free to use, but the free tier comes with limited access to the latest models. The Plus plan, currently $20/month, unlocks full access to advanced features and faster performance.\n\n### [Gr‎ok](https://grok.com/)\n\n![Image 45: image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65e89895c5a4b8d764c0d70e/68622f777c792d49e78f9017_autl9xvkt4.webp)\n\nWhile Grok can be used as a standalone AI assistant, you're most likely to see it in action on X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\nI'm not entirely sure if the Grok integration makes X a better place, since half the comments on any post I read now involve users tagging Grok to fact-check the original poster. It’s probably a net good—it holds people more accountable to the truth—but I also think it's disrupted the natural flow of conversation on Elon's social media behemoth.\n\nGrok is a super smart model, and I love that it's basically uncensored. It comes with several reasoning modes, like 'Think', which gives the model more time to process and refine its response, and 'Deep Search', which searches the internet using what feels like a RAG-style setup.\n\nThe lack of censorship also extends to its impressive image generation capabilities, which makes it my go-to if I want to generate pictures of celebrities, brands, or just crank out a good meme.\n\nYou can try Grok for free with limited access, but to unlock higher usage limits and the latest models, you'll need one of X’s paid tiers: Basic, Premium, or Premium+.\n\n### [Claude](https://claude.ai/)\n\nPlay\n\nClaude has been the go-to AI assistant for coding for a while now. Some of the other tools on this list are starting to catch up, but I still think it’s fair to say most developers swear by Claude. I’m not a professional developer, but I dabble—and when I do, Claude is usually my first choice.\n\nIt’s especially good at writing clean, well-documented code, and even better at explaining what that code does in plain English. In my experience, Claude’s code tends to be more reliable too. I’ve had fewer issues with hallucinated variables or broken logic compared to when I’ve used ChatGPT.\n\nI also just like how Claude communicates. It feels collaborative—more like it’s solving the problem with me, not just spitting out answers I have to wrangle into shape.\n\nClaude is free to use, with a Pro plan at $20/month for more features and usage, and a Max plan starting at $100/month for higher limits and early access.\n\n### [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nGemini is Google’s AI assistant, and at the time of writing, it currently sits at the top of the LLM Arena leaderboard—a ranking based on millions of blind tests where users choose their favorite AI responses.\n\nOne of the main reasons I use Gemini is its insanely large context window. A context window is the amount of text an AI can remember and work with during a conversation, so the bigger it is, the more information you can feed it and ask questions about. The latest Gemini models support over 1 million tokens of context, which means I can drop in a lengthy academic paper and ask a bunch of follow-up questions without it missing a beat.\n\nAnother feature I love is Gemini’s audio overview. With it, I can upload a document and get a podcast-style, five-minute audio summary hosted by AI voices. It’s perfect for digesting long documents during my commute.\n\nGemini offers a free plan with basic AI tools, while paid Pro and Ultra plans unlock more advanced models, creative features, and increased storage. Pricing starts at $19.99/month for Pro and $124.99/month for Ultra.\n\nTh‎e best AI video generators\n-----------------------------\n\n### [Synthesia](https://www.synthesia.io/)\n\nPlay\n\nSynthesia is the leading [AI video generator](https://www.synthesia.io/features/ai-video-generator) which allows you to [generate realistic AI human avatar videos](https://www.synthesia.io/features/avatars). I’ve used it for creating training modules and presentations, and it’s clear why it’s a favorite for [learning and development teams](https://www.synthesia.io/learning-and-development). By [turning text into video](https://www.synthesia.io/features/text-to-video), Synthesia simplifies the production of high-quality content without the need for cameras, microphones, or studios.\n\nIts most popular use case is undoubtedly [training videos](https://www.synthesia.io/learn/training-videos), but Synthesia is versatile enough to handle a wide range of needs. Businesses use it for internal communications, onboarding new employees, and creating customer support or knowledge base videos. On the marketing side, it excels in producing personalized sales outreach videos, B2B marketing content, [explainer videos](https://www.synthesia.io/tools/explainer-video-maker) and even product demos.\n\nI’ve personally also found it handy for website videos that needed a polished, professional touch with minimal effort. Synthesia is super easy to use, you just [type in your script and then generate your video.](https://www.synthesia.io/tools/script-to-video-maker)\n\nTwo things I love about Synthesia are the ability to [customize avatars](https://www.synthesia.io/features/custom-avatar) and the wide variety of templates offered. When I needed to create tailored training videos for different departments, Synthesia made it easy to switch the avatar language, tone, or background to suit the audience. The library of over 240 [digital avatars](https://www.synthesia.io/tools/digital-human) and support for 140+ languages means you can create globally consistent content effortlessly.\n\nWhile [Synthesia shines for AI talking head video generation](https://www.synthesia.io/tools/talking-head-video-maker), it’s not designed for storytelling or cinematic visuals. It’s best for teams and businesses that prioritize speed, professionalism, and brand consistency in their video production workflows.\n\nSynthesia offers a free plan that allows users to generate up to 36 minutes of video per year, with no credit card required. For more extensive features, paid plans start at $29 per month.\n\n### [Google Veo](https://deepmind.google/models/veo/)\n\nPlay\n\nGoogle's Veo is an impressive tool for generating creative AI videos, capable of producing visuals for almost anything—though its content moderation is fairly strict.\n\nI mostly use Veo to create b-roll for social media marketing videos. Veo 2 is quite affordable, and while it occasionally produces odd results with action scenes, the physics are among the most realistic I’ve seen in AI-generated video.\n\nVeo 3 is more expensive but adds the ability to generate audio as well, which makes it significantly more useful in my opinion.\n\nYou can try Veo 2 for free in Google AI Studio, where a limited number of free credits are available for testing.\n\nTo access Veo 3, you’ll need either the $19.99/month Google AI Pro plan or the $249.99/month Ultra plan.\n\n### [OpusClip](https://www.opus.pro/)\n\nPlay\n\nOpusClip is a great tool for breaking down longer videos into short, shareable clips for social media. It’s straightforward to use and does a lot of the heavy lifting for you.\n\nThe AI feature is surprisingly effective at finding the best parts of a video, so I didn’t have to spend ages scrubbing through footage. It also resized my clips automatically to fit platforms like TikTok and Instagram.\n\nAdding captions is quick and simple, and the option to throw in emojis makes the clips feel more dynamic—especially useful for grabbing attention in silent scrolling. I also really liked the “hook” feature that picks out key moments to start the clip off strong.\n\nOpus Clip makes it easy to create eye-catching content from videos I’ve already made. It’s practical, efficient, and takes some of the hassle out of social media editing.\n\nThe best AI image generators\n----------------------------\n\n### [Nano Banana](https://aistudio.google.com/models/gemini-2-5-flash-image)\n\nPlay\n\nGoogle’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model, better known as Nano Banana, is incredible. It’s easy to use, lightning fast, and lets you make almost any edit to an image.\n\nI’ve been using it for video creation by generating a Synthesia video, downloading it as an MP4, and grabbing a screenshot of the first frame. I upload that still into Nano Banana and type a prompt — for example, “add a yellow hard hat and a high viz jacket.” It then generates the new image, and the edits are pretty much always exactly what I asked for.\n\nNext, I ask it to change the background of my image to a busy construction site without distorting the subject (the presenter in the middle of the shot). From there, I animate the edited still back into a video using Runway’s Act Two. It takes a bit of trial and error, but the end result is smooth and realistic.\n\nPut simply, Nano Banana covers nearly every kind of image editing you might need. It can handle quick touch-ups and background swaps, add texting, and even full scene transformations. Some popular use cases include using it to turn selfies into 3D figurines, trying out new outfits or hairstyles, redesigning rooms, and reimagining photos in completely different styles.\n\n### [GPT-4o](https://chatgpt.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nRemember when everyone was generating Studio Ghibli–style AI images of themselves, their pets, and anything else they could think of? That was all powered by the built-in image generation in ChatGPT-4o.\n\nIt supports both text-to-image and image-to-image transformations across a wide range of art styles, so I’ve found it useful for all kinds of tasks. Personally, I use it to create royalty-free images for blog posts and social media posts—and now that it can reliably generate text within images (something tools like DALL·E 3 struggled with), it's even more valuable.\n\nThe feature is available on the free tier of ChatGPT, though there are daily usage limits. You can lift those by upgrading to a Plus or Pro plan.\n\n### [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/)\n\n![Image 46: image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65e89895c5a4b8d764c0d70e/674443cd7f4832d940a4e34b_rlm0oj1zbs.webp)\n\nMidjourney can be considered the OG of AI image generation. It’s been around since early 2022 and is still often favored for its painterly aesthetic and for creating source images for image-to-video generation.\n\nTo be honest, I mostly use the built-in image tools in my go-to AI assistants like ChatGPT or Gemini. But when I want to generate something genuinely beautiful, I turn to Midjourney.\n\nOne downside is that Midjourney no longer offers a free plan—you have to subscribe to a paid tier to generate even a single image. There are four plans available, starting at $10/month, with higher tiers offering more generation time and advanced features like video support and stealth mode.\n\nThe best AI meeting assistants\n------------------------------\n\n### [Fathom](https://www.fathom.video/)\n\n![Image 47: image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65e89895c5a4b8d764c0d70e/67a342cec14b9b67ea4b4dd6_fathom.webp)\n\nYou might have seen Fathom pop up during work calls—it’s one of the most genuinely useful AI tools I use day-to-day.\n\nIt’s an AI notetaker that joins your Zoom or Microsoft Teams meetings, records the entire conversation, and tracks who said what. If I forget an action item, need to revisit an explanation, or just want to double-check what someone said, it's incredibly handy.\n\nAlongside a full transcript, Fathom generates a clear, structured summary. In my experience, the notes are consistently accurate and well-organized.\n\nThe app is free to use with a few limits. Premium plans start at $19/month and unlock unlimited AI features and deeper integrations. For what it offers—especially how well it captures questions and action items—it’s tough to beat.\n\nIt’s one of those tools that makes you wonder how you ever worked without it.\n\n### [Nyota](https://www.nyota.ai/)\n\n![Image 48: Nyota.ai — The AI Meeting Assistant to Manage Projects and People](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65e89895c5a4b8d764c0d70e/67a342cfc14b9b67ea4b4dde_k8oztk17h5.webp)\n\nWhile Fathom is a solid free option, Nyota feels like a more premium, polished version with some impressive extra features. Like Fathom, it records your meetings and generates AI-powered transcripts and summaries. But Nyota goes further by automating the follow-up tasks that usually eat up time after a call—things like data entry and updating your CRM based on what was discussed.\n\nThat means I can have a call with a prospect and, without lifting a finger afterward, get a full summary and see my CRM updated with the key points from the conversation. Honestly, that feels like magic.\n\nOf course, those extras come at a cost. Nyota is a paid tool, though they do offer a 7-day free trial. Pricing starts at $12/month for individuals, $39 for small teams, $89 for larger teams, and there's custom pricing for enterprise. Higher tiers give you more meeting hours and unlock advanced features.\n\nThe best AI automation tools\n----------------------------\n\n### [n8n](https://n8n.io/)\n\nPlay\n\nn8n lets you automate tasks that are boring, repetitive, or just take too much time. It can feel a bit intimidating at first, but I’ve found it surprisingly easy to use once you get the hang of it.\n\nTo build an automation in n8n, you connect apps and services into a visual workflow. You simply drag and link nodes together — it’s a very intuitive setup.\n\nYou don’t need to know how to code to build useful automations. But if you do code, n8n gives you the flexibility to add custom functions and go deeper.\n\nOne workflow I set up does a daily backup of important data to a Google Sheet. Here’s how it works:\n\nTrigger: Every day at 6am\n\nGet Data: Pull records from an internal SQL database\n\nGoogle Sheets: Append the data to my spreadsheet\n\nIt runs quietly in the background and saves me time every morning.\n\nn8n’s pricing starts at €20/month for 2,500 executions and basic features. The Pro plan (€50/month) adds more workflows, faster execution, and admin tools. Enterprise plans offer full customization and support, with pricing on request.\n\n### [Manus](https://manus.im/)\n\nPlay\n\nI've played around with Manus quite a bit, and it's pretty awesome. It's an AI agent you can use to perform a variety of tasks, from creating slides and analyzing data to generating images and videos, building web pages, and handling programming tasks. It does this by combining different LLMs and other model types to carry out your requests.\n\nI tested it on a range of tasks, including researching the causes of the 2008 global financial crisis and then building a financial blog website to publish the research. The final output included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, along with image assets for the site. I thought the site looked super professional.\n\nCompared to other AI agent products—like ChatGPT's Operator feature—I think Manus offers a better experience. I found it executes the tasks I set more reliably, and the output quality is higher.\n\nManus has a decent free plan with 300 daily credits and basic features. Paid plans start at $16/month, unlocking more credits, advanced models, and media generation.\n\nThe best AI research tools\n--------------------------\n\n### [Deep Research](https://chatgpt.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nOpenAI’s Deep Research feature can find, analyze, and synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report on any subject you want in just a few minutes.\n\nWhile I suspect the most common use case is students cheating on homework, it’s actually a great tool for building your own knowledge on anything you’re curious about.\n\nAt work, I mostly use it for market and competitive research or summarizing industry trends. But my favourite use is analyzing public sentiment. If you ask something like “What are Reddit users saying about [your company]?”, it gives you a super useful snapshot of how people are talking about your brand across online communities.\n\nThe reports can take a little while to generate, but that’s fair enough considering how many sources they pull in.\n\nFree ChatGPT users get 5 Deep Research tasks per month. Paid plans get more: Plus, Team, and Edu get 10, while Pro users get 125.\n\n### [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)\n\nPlay\n\nI last used NotebookLM to study for an exam. I uploaded a bunch of notes and course materials, and it gave me a super clear, helpful overview of everything. The best part is the audio summary feature—it turns your content into an AI-generated podcast that actually helps you retain the key points.\n\nIt’s not perfect—you have to double-check things now and then—but it does a great job of organizing complex material and making it easier to absorb. Honestly, I couldn’t believe it was free.\n\nNotebookLM’s free tier gives you up to 100 notebooks and 50 sources per notebook, with daily limits on queries and audio summaries. If you need more, the $19.99/month AI Premium plan includes 500 notebooks, 300 sources each, higher usage limits, and access to Gemini Advanced. Students with a .edu email can unlock premium for free.\n\nThe best AI writing tools\n-------------------------\n\n### [Rytr](https://rytr.me/)\n\n![Image 49: image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65e89895c5a4b8d764c0d70e/674443cd7f4832d940a4e345_w13wo48m7b.webp)\n\nThe big question with any AI writing tool is: why use it over ChatGPT or another general assistant?\n\nRytr is an AI writing assistant designed for generating quick, polished content — especially for short-form tasks like social media posts, product descriptions, and email drafts.\n\nCompared to ChatGPT, Rytr feels more focused and purpose-built for writing. ChatGPT is great for brainstorming and idea exploration, but Rytr shines when you need something formatted, professional, and ready to use with minimal back-and-forth. It also includes a built-in plagiarism checker for peace of mind, and supports over 30 languages — great for multilingual content creation.\n\nIts library of 40+ pre-designed templates helped me get started faster, especially when I wasn’t sure how to structure a piece.\n\nThat said, Rytr does struggle with longer or more complex writing, so I wouldn’t use it for deep-dive articles. But for quick, high-quality content, it’s fast, effective, and affordable — starting at just $9/month. If you're a freelancer, marketer, or small business owner looking for a streamlined writing tool, Rytr is a solid choice.\n\n### [Sudowrite](https://sudowrite.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nI'm an aspiring novelist in my spare time, so I snuck this one into the list.\n\nI’ve been using Sudowrite as a creative writing assistant, and it’s an excellent tool for anyone working on fiction. It’s ideal for overcoming writer’s block, generating fresh ideas, and crafting more vivid narratives.\n\nFeatures like the ‘Describe’ tool, which helps create immersive descriptions, and ‘Brainstorm,’ which sparks creative plot points, have significantly improved my storytelling process. The ‘Expand’ feature is also useful for turning rough outlines into fully developed drafts.\n\nUnlike ChatGPT or Rytr, Sudowrite isn’t designed for creating emails, product descriptions, or blog posts. Its focus is entirely on fiction—helping you write better dialogue, build richer characters, and refine your narrative structure. For instance, when I was stuck on a scene, Sudowrite provided thoughtful suggestions to enhance the pacing and tension. It's the ultimate weapon against writers block - even if you don't end up using what it comes up with, it'll still get you thinking about the next sentence in a different way.\n\nWhile it’s not suitable for business writing or technical content, it’s a fantastic choice for novelists, short story writers, or anyone experimenting with creative projects. With plans starting at $19/month, Sudowrite offers a unique way to elevate your fiction writing.\n\nThe best AI search engines\n--------------------------\n\n### [Google AI Mode](https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-search/)\n\nPlay\n\nYou’ve probably seen Google’s 'AI Overviews' show up in search results. In my experience, they’re hit-or-miss—sometimes helpful, but often surface-level or just plain wrong.\n\nStill, Google seems committed to reshaping how we search, doubling down with its new 'AI Mode', which essentially blends Gemini with traditional search.\n\nFor answering straightforward informational questions, I think it’s a big step up from clicking through a bunch of pages to find one specific detail.\n\nWhere it struggles is with more nuanced or niche queries. Because large language models generate responses based on statistical patterns in their training data, you’re often left with a “most likely” answer rather than a surprising or original one. Traditional search, on the other hand, can lead you to that obscure blog post or forgotten forum thread that shifts your perspective.\n\nAI Mode is currently free and opt-in, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it becomes the default before long. When that happens, we might all end up missing the good old 10 blue links.\n\n### [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)\n\nPlay\n\nWhile ChatGPT Search and Google’s AI mode have stolen some of Perplexity’s thunder — and the company is now rumored to be an Apple acquisition target — I still turn to Perplexity when I want fast, trustworthy answers with clearly cited sources I can actually verify.\n\nWhat makes Perplexity feel more reliable is exactly that: I can see where each point comes from. In contrast, Google’s AI mode feels like a black box — it’s often unclear which part of the answer came from which source.\n\nThe free version is great for casual use, but if you rely on Perplexity for deeper research, the Pro plan is a worthwhile upgrade.\n\n### [ChatGPT Search](https://chatgpt.com/)\n\n![Image 50: image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65e89895c5a4b8d764c0d70e/674443cb7f4832d940a4e2bd_po9ezyarie.webp)\n\nChatGPT Search is now almost unnoticeable in my daily ChatGPT use—when I ask questions, the platform will often do a web search automatically without me having to give any special instruction. That said, it's still available as an explicit option when you select \"Search the web\" in the prompt box.\n\nSimilar to Google's AI mode and Perplexity, when I ask a question, I get a summarized answer instead of a list of links. It's also more of a conversation—it remembers my previous questions and follows up in context, which makes it much easier to dig deeper into a topic without rephrasing my query each time.\n\nI also love that there are no ads. Google's AI mode will no doubt be plastered with ads soon, and traditional search is already so full of them it’s almost unbearable.\n\nAnother thing I really value is being able to customize the output. For example, if I want ChatGPT to explain something in simpler terms, I can just ask. If I want the response in a table or CSV file, it can handle that too.\n\nChatGPT Search is now integrated into all ChatGPT plans, including the free plan.\n\nThe best AI design tools\n------------------------\n\n### [Canva Magic Studio](https://www.canva.com/magic/)\n\nPlay\n\nCanva is a hugely popular design tool, known for its ease of use—and with the addition of its AI-powered Magic Studio suite, it becomes even more powerful.\n\nMagic Studio includes a variety of features that streamline and enhance the creative process.\n\nMagic Design lets you input a prompt or upload an image to generate personalized templates for formats like social media posts and presentations. I often turn to it when I'm short on inspiration, and it gives me a solid starting point.\n\nMagic Write helps you craft content by generating text based on your prompts. It’s been especially handy for breaking through writer’s block and drafting copy.\n\nMagic Edit makes it easy to tweak images by changing colors or removing elements—perfect for quick edits without needing a more complex photo editing tool.\n\nMagic Eraser takes that a step further, allowing you to cleanly remove unwanted objects from photos, which I've found useful when prepping images for social media.\n\nMagic Animate adds movement to static designs, helping create engaging presentations or social content that stands out.\n\nCanva follows a freemium model. You can try some Magic Studio tools for free with limitations—for example, Magic Write can be used up to 50 times total at no cost. Upgrading to Canva Pro ($15/month) or Canva for Teams ($30/month for 3 seats) bumps that up to 250 uses per person, per month.\n\n### [Looka](https://looka.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nLooka is an AI-powered logo and brand design tool. I tested it on two of my side projects—one is an Airbnb property management company, the other a digital marketing agency.\n\nIt’s super easy to use. I just entered my company name and a short description of what it does. Then Looka showed me a bunch of sample logos and asked me to pick the ones I liked. This helped train the AI to match my style. After choosing a color scheme, I got a range of AI-generated logos tailored to my business.\n\nThe quality was surprisingly high. Once I picked my favorite, I used the drag-and-drop editor to make a few small tweaks.\n\nAfter selecting my favorite, Looka then generates a brand kit with your logo used on a bunch of different 'brand essentials'.\n\nLooka offers two main pricing options: a one-time Premium Logo Package for $65, which includes high-res files, full ownership, and unlimited edits, or an annual Brand Kit Subscription starting at $96/year that adds branded assets like social posts, business cards, and more. For $129/year, you can also get a website bundled with the Brand Kit.\n\nThe best AI app builders & coding tools\n---------------------------------------\n\n### [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)\n\nPlay\n\nLovable is one of Europe’s fastest-growing startups, and it’s easy to see why. The idea of an app that lets anyone—regardless of coding experience—build software just by prompting it into existence is incredibly compelling. And surprisingly, it kind of works.\n\nI tested it by building a few different apps and websites of increasing complexity. It nailed a digital marketer portfolio site and a task manager-style productivity app. I also used it to generate a calculator widget for a landing page on a client’s site, and it gave me a fully functional mini-app I could embed in an iframe with zero fuss.\n\nThat’s the beauty of Lovable—if you’re a non-coder, it opens up a whole new world of what you can do on a computer and makes you look like a genius in the process.\n\nThat said, let’s keep expectations realistic. You’re not going to prompt your way into a fully-fledged, enterprise-grade SaaS business. Those still require thousands of hours from skilled engineers. But what’s exciting about Lovable isn’t just where it is today—it’s where it could go next.\n\nPricing is simple: there's a free plan for basic use, a $25/month Pro plan with more features, and custom Enterprise plans for larger teams.\n\n### [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nIf you're more technical and want greater control over your code than you'll get with an AI-powered app builder, Cursor is currently the most popular AI-powered IDE (Integrated Development Environment — the kind of app developers use to write code). It's pretty fun to pair-program with an AI.\n\nI like using Cursor because it feels familiar — it’s a fork of VS Code, which is what I originally learned to program in, so there’s no learning curve.\n\nI think Cursor’s popularity comes down to two key strengths. First, it’s great at navigating large projects — it understands dependencies and offers file-aware suggestions that actually make sense. Second, it has a strong grasp of development context, like file structure, imports, and naming conventions, which means I spend less time fixing AI-generated code.\n\nAnother big plus: the free tier is generous. While the Pro plan ($25/month) gives you access to more advanced AI models and priority updates, the free version is more than enough for most day-to-day use.\n\nThe best AI knowledge management tools\n--------------------------------------\n\n### [Notion Q&A](https://www.notion.com/product/ai)\n\nPlay\n\nNotion Q&A is a powerful tool that helps you tap into a company’s entire knowledge base across thousands of Notion pages. I started using it at my new job, and it quickly became one of my favorite AI tools.\n\nAs an introvert, I loved being able to ask any question—without interrupting anyone—and instantly get a detailed, accurate answer drawn from everything stored in both our company Notion workspace and across all our Slack channels. It felt like having a personal assistant who knew exactly where to find information from every corner of the company.\n\nWhile my company has only connected Slack, Notion can also pull answers from other connected external tools, including Google Drive, Github, and Zendesk.\n\nWhat makes Notion Q&A stand out—especially compared to something like Google Drive search—is that it doesn’t just link to documents. It gives you direct answers pulled from the actual content, making it much faster to find what you need.\n\nI also like how it cites the source of each piece of information so that you can easily see the source and verify key details. This saved me countless hours when I needed quick, detailed information and needed to know where it came from.\n\nNotion Q&A is priced as an add-on at $10 per user per month (or $8/month when billed annually). It’s a fair price for what it offers, though it can add up for larger teams. Still, I think it’s worth it.\n\n### [Guru](https://www.getguru.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nGuru is a dedicated knowledge management platform that offers similar functionality to Notion Q&A, but with a key difference: Guru surfaces answers directly in context. That means I can ask Guru questions within tools like Slack, my CRM, or anywhere it’s integrated — and it pulls in relevant information from those platforms automatically. In practice, this makes the responses feel much more useful, since Guru has access to a broader set of real-time data.\n\nHere’s how I see it: Guru is ideal for teams that need a comprehensive, integrated knowledge solution that fits into their existing workflows. Notion Q&A, on the other hand, is a lighter, lower-commitment option — and perfect if your team, like mine, already stores most of its content in Notion.\n\nThe downside? Guru is on the pricier side at $15 per user/month.\n\nThe best AI email assistants\n----------------------------\n\n### [Hubspot AI Email Writer](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/ai-email-writer)\n\nPlay\n\nHubSpot offers an [AI-powered email assistant](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/ai-email-writer) designed to kickstart your creative juices and help write up personalized emails at scale. The platform’s AI assistant generates copy fit for various email campaigns, like sales outreach, marketing newsletters, and so on.\n\nYou can then edit or repurpose generated drafts by automatically changing their tones as well as lengthening or shortening them. HubSpot also includes a drag-and-drop email template builder with numerous customizable use-case-specific presets, perfect for further streamlining creative processes.\n\nWhat I found most useful is that HubSpot’s AI email writer links with the platform’s CRM database. That means you can roll out email campaigns and automatically log conversations to your contact lists. From there, you can track progress and send out follow-ups at the right time to maximize response rates. Plus, you can use the platform’s AI assistant directly from your Gmail account, which spares you the need to juggle between multiple tabs.\n\nHubSpot’s AI Email Writer is a solid choice for busy marketing and sales teams looking to scale up their efforts and maximize results without increasing headcount.\n\nThe email writing assistant is available for free, while more advanced email functionalities are available throughout HubSpot’s Marketing Hub paid packages. Pricing starts at $15 per month.\n\n### [Fyxer](https://www.fyxer.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nFyxer is a fast-growing AI executive assistant that claims it can win back at least an hour of your day. I decided to put that to the test by connecting it to my work Gmail account.\n\nAfter it trained on my past emails, it started doing two main things. First, it automatically categorized my incoming emails into folders that actually made sense, which genuinely made it easier to find specific conversations.\n\nSecond, it began suggesting draft responses. Fyxer says it takes time for the AI to learn your voice, but I found the drafts were surprisingly close to how I’d write from the start. Of course, it couldn't answer highly specific questions that my inbox didn't contain the answer to, but it significantly reduced the number of emails I had to write from scratch. Editing its suggestions was much faster than starting with a blank email.\n\nFyxer also includes an AI meeting note taker, which works well—though I still prefer the dedicated tools I mentioned earlier.\n\nPricing starts at $30/month, with more advanced features at $50 and custom options for enterprise teams. All plans come with a 7-day free trial.\n\n### [Shortwave](https://www.shortwave.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nShortwave is an AI email assistant that helps you organize, write, search, and schedule emails.\n\nIt doesn’t include an AI meeting note-taker like Fyxer does, but that was fine for me since I already use a separate AI tool for meeting notes.\n\nWhat Shortwave does offer is excellent email organization, far better search capabilities (which is a lifesaver if you're like me and constantly digging through old emails for invoices and contracts), and fast AI-assisted drafting and suggestions.\n\nHere’s how I think about it: I’d use Shortwave for my personal inbox — it’s lightweight, affordable, and great for everyday use. For work, I’d go with Fyxer to take advantage of its meeting features and deeper automation.\n\nShortwave has a free plan with AI assistance, inbox customization, and 90 days of searchable history. The Personal Plan is $8.50 per seat/month and adds more power for everyday users.\n\nThe best AI scheduling tools\n----------------------------\n\n### [Reclaim](https://reclaim.ai/)\n\nPlay\n\nReclaim is an AI-powered scheduling assistant that helps you optimize your calendar by automatically managing tasks, meetings, and breaks based on your priorities. Since I started using it, it’s significantly reduced the mental effort of planning my day.\n\nAfter connecting it to my Google Calendar, I entered my tasks and meetings with their priority levels. Reclaim then automatically assigned time slots, ensuring I stayed on top of what mattered most.\n\nOne of the most useful features is how it protects deep work time by blocking off hours for focus and preventing unnecessary meeting overlaps. It’s also great for scheduling with others — it finds optimal meeting times based on everyone’s availability and preferences, cutting down on back-and-forth coordination.\n\nReclaim offers a free Lite Plan with core time-blocking features, and a Starter Plan at $10/user/month for more advanced scheduling support.\n\n### [Clockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nClockwise is an AI-powered scheduling assistant that optimizes your calendar by managing meetings and protecting blocks of focus time. Since I started using it, it’s helped me stay more organized and get more deep work done.\n\nOnce connected to my Google Calendar, I marked certain meetings as flexible. Clockwise automatically rescheduled them to open up longer focus periods, which noticeably improved my productivity.\n\nIt also made meeting coordination easier by finding the best times for all participants, cutting down on the usual back-and-forth. Compared to Reclaim, which handles both task and meeting scheduling, Clockwise focuses more narrowly on optimizing meeting times and creating uninterrupted work windows. I found Reclaim more useful overall because of its broader scope, but Clockwise excels if your main pain point is meeting overload.\n\nClockwise offers a Free Plan with core calendar optimization features. Paid plans start at $7.75/month.\n\nThe best AI presentation makers\n-------------------------------\n\n### [Gamma](https://gamma.app/)\n\nPlay\n\nIn my current job, I have to present all the time — to clients, my boss, and the rest of my team. So any tool that can make that part of my job easier, save me time, and help me get better results is more than welcome.\n\nGamma has been great for building presentations from scratch, but I’ve also used it to turn my notes into decks, and even to repurpose existing presentations and PDFs. It handles all three scenarios surprisingly well.\n\nIf I’m starting from scratch, I usually head straight to Gamma’s “Generate a Presentation” tool. I’ll type in a prompt like “I need a presentation explaining the different types of digital marketing channels”, specify how many slides I want, and it gives me a solid outline I can tweak and reorder. Then I hit generate — and I get a full presentation in seconds.\n\nThe quality is genuinely impressive. The generated slides always have a sleek design and include AI-generated images that look consistent and professional, and they certainly look much better than what I’d make myself in PowerPoint or Google Slides. I’ll usually make a few edits — adding my own points, data, or anecdotes — but for the most part, they’re ready to go.\n\nI’ve also found it handy that Gamma can export to PowerPoint format (.pptx), which is useful when I need to share a deck with a client who’ll open it in PowerPoint.\n\nGamma has a Free Plan that includes 400 AI credits, basic image generation, and up to 10 slides per presentation. The Plus Plan ($10/user/month) unlocks unlimited AI creation, more slides, better image tools, and priority support.\n\nDon't forget to [convert your PowerPoint slides to video](https://www.synthesia.io/powerpoint-to-video) when you're done.\n\n### [Copilot for Powerpoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot-powerpoint)\n\nPlay\n\nWhile it’s not as slick as Gamma, I still use PowerPoint from time to time — especially with the Copilot for PowerPoint feature.\n\nLike Gamma, it lets me generate an entire presentation from an existing file, a few notes, or just a well-written prompt. It’s surprisingly good at pulling together a structured deck from minimal input.\n\nThe biggest advantage Copilot has over Gamma is familiarity — almost everyone already knows how to use PowerPoint, so there’s no learning curve.\n\nThat said, if I wasn’t already using Microsoft 365 for work, I probably wouldn’t pay for Copilot separately. Gamma is more affordable, and I personally prefer building slides in a modern, web-based tool rather than a traditional desktop program.\n\nFor context, Microsoft Copilot for PowerPoint requires either a Copilot Pro subscription at around $20/month, or the Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on at $30/month on top of a qualifying Microsoft 365 plan.\n\nThe best AI resume builders\n---------------------------\n\n### [Teal Resume Builder](https://www.tealhq.com/tools/resume-builder)\n\nPlay\n\nTeal is an AI-powered resume builder that helps streamline the resume writing process and tailor it to specific job applications — something I’ve always found tedious and time-consuming.\n\nAfter entering my job history, skills, and goals, Teal generated a live resume preview with bullet points based on my experience. For example, when I added a past marketing role, it suggested phrases like “increased engagement by 30%” or “managed a team of 5,” giving my resume a polished, results-driven tone without much effort.\n\nTeal highlights key skills and phrases from the a job posting and suggests how to integrate them into your resume. I tried this with a marketing manager role, and it helped me align my resume with the job in just a few clicks.\n\nTeal also has a popular job application tracking tool too.\n\nTeal’s Free Plan includes unlimited resumes and job tracking, while the Teal+ Plan costs $29/month and unlocks all premium features.\n\n### [Kickresume](https://www.kickresume.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nI personally prefer Teal for the smart suggestions it gives to tailor my resume to each job. That said, I think Kickresume produces a better-looking final product.\n\nIt offers over 40 resume templates, which it claims are designed by HR experts and typographers — and honestly, I believe it. The templates look sleek, professional, and modern. They're also ATS-compliant, which gave me peace of mind knowing that the AI scanners most companies use will be able to read my resume without issues.\n\nAnother nice bonus: Kickresume lets you turn your resume into a personal website with just a few clicks, so you don’t need to use a separate tool for that.\n\nKickresume’s Free Plan includes basic resume and cover letter templates, a website builder, and access to 20,000+ pre-written phrases. The Monthly Plan ($19/month) unlocks premium templates, full customization, an AI resume checker, and priority support.\n\nThe best AI voice generators\n----------------------------\n\n### [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)\n\nPlay\n\nElevenLabs is the clear leader in [AI voice generation](https://www.synthesia.io/features/ai-voice-generator). They offer text-to-speech and voice cloning capabilities.\n\nIt's a lot of fun to play around with, the AI-generated voices sound really natural and there's a huge amount of flexibility. You can adjust the language spoken, the voices, and the number of speakers. I also really liked the voice tags functionality, which let me control the delivery and emotions of the speech I was generating, so I could change from [whispers] to [sarcastic] and then to [laughs] all within the same passage of text.\n\nThings got pretty freaky when I tried cloning my own voice. Once cloned, you can then prompt your own voice via text-to-speech. The AI voice sounded exactly like mine which I think is why it was such an unsettling experience.\n\nI should also mention ElevenLabs AI Dubbing Studio, which really impressed me with its ability to create voiceovers and dub content in multiple languages. I uploaded a video and was able to quickly generate high-quality voiceover tracks in different voices and accents. It's a bit pricey, and there's no video dubbing/lip-sync capabilities (for that, check out [Synthesia's AI video dubbing](https://www.synthesia.io/features/ai-dubbing)), but otherwise I thought it was a pretty neat extra set of features and it's definitely one of my favourite [video translation apps](https://www.synthesia.io/post/best-video-translator-apps).\n\nElevenLabs offers a free plan with 10k credits, while paid plans start at $5/month for more credits, voice cloning, and commercial use. Higher tiers unlock pro features like better audio quality and API access for large-scale projects.\n\n### [Murf](https://murf.ai/)\n\nPlay\n\nIf I’m working on a project that needs narration, I almost always go with an AI-generated voice. It saves me the hassle of setting up a microphone, dealing with noise cancellation, and — honestly — I’m just not a fan of hearing my own voice.\n\nWhile ElevenLabs is the undisputed leader in AI voice quality, I think Murf can be a better option for non-technical users.\n\nMurf has a clean, drag-and-drop interface that makes it easy to create voiceovers quickly. It might not have the same technical depth or realism as ElevenLabs, but it still delivers solid results — especially for things like explainer videos or internal presentations.\n\nMurf’s Free Plan gives you 10 minutes of voice generation and transcription, access to 120+ voices, and basic audio/video sharing. The Creator Plan, at $29/month, unlocks unlimited downloads, 200+ voices, 2 hours of voice generation per month, and commercial usage rights.\n\nThe best AI music generators\n----------------------------\n\n### [Suno](https://suno.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nAt work, I use Suno to generate background music for social posts, videos, and ads. It’s perfect for creating original, royalty-free tracks that sound great—and it only takes a simple prompt.\n\nSuno is also one of the most fun tools on this list. I’ve found myself using it in my spare time just to experiment with new songs in the style of my favorite artists.\n\nFor example, I generated an awesome track with this prompt:\n\n_A high-energy, funky pop song in the style of Michael Jackson (circa \"Bad\" era), about the late-night grind of writing a blog post. Catchy verses about researching, editing, and battling writer's block, with a smooth, soulful chorus that celebrates hitting publish. Include MJ-style ad-libs (\"hee-hee!\", \"shamone!\") and signature vocal flair._\n\nWhile AI music still lacks the emotional depth of human-made songs, it’s incredibly fun and useful for creative projects. I don’t think we’ll be listening to AI tracks for pure enjoyment just yet—but we’re getting closer.\n\nSuno’s free plan includes 50 daily credits for up to 10 songs a day (personal use only). The $10/month Pro plan gives you 2,500 credits, commercial rights, faster generation, and the ability to run 10 tasks at once.\n\nIf you’re using it at work for anything public-facing, like I am, you’ll need the Pro plan for the commercial license.\n\n### [Udio](https://www.udio.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nI think Udio is better suited for musicians who want to use AI as a starting point and then iterate on their creations. Its editing options are more flexible than Suno’s—though still not quite on par with traditional music production software.\n\nIf I want more control over how a song comes together, I’m probably choosing Udio. It lets me shape, tweak, and refine everything—whether that’s regenerating a chorus I didn’t like, extending a verse I loved, or fine-tuning the lyrics until they feel just right.\n\nIt’s not as fast or polished out of the box as Suno, but if structure and customization matter to you, Udio is the stronger option.\n\nUdio offers a free plan with 100 credits per month for up to 50 songs and basic tools. For more, the Standard Plan costs $10/month.\n\nThe best AI marketing tools\n---------------------------\n\n### [AdCreative](https://www.adcreative.ai/)\n\nPlay\n\nAdCreative is an AI-powered platform that streamlines the process of creating ad creatives for platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Google Ads. After testing it, I found it to be a convenient, time-saving tool that produces professional results.\n\nAs someone without a design background, I appreciated how quickly I could create usable ads. I just entered basic campaign details—like the product and target audience—and the tool generated multiple polished ad designs tailored for different platforms. I found that the generated designs typically only needed minor tweaks.\n\nThe interface is intuitive and beginner-friendly. I could easily adjust text, swap images, and add my logo to match my branding. AdCreative made it simple for me to generate multiple ad variations for A/B testing with slight changes in headlines or visuals.\n\nPricing starts at $39/month, which is reasonable for frequent users and far cheaper than hiring a designer. But for occasional use—especially if you need to heavily edit the outputs—the cost might feel a bit steep.\n\n### [AirOps](https://www.airops.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nAirOps is marketed as a content operations engine, with a core focus on scalable content creation. While I primarily use it to generate blog posts, I’ve also used it to refresh landing pages, suggest ad copy, check backlink quality, and produce SEO metadata for hundreds of pages at once. It saves me from boring, repetitive tasks and lets me focus on higher-value work.\n\nBuilding complex workflows is easy thanks to the drag-and-drop interface. There are plenty of standard steps, but I especially like the “power steps” — prebuilt modules that handle common tasks like keyword research or identifying content cannibalization.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the range of models available. AirOps lets you build workflows using the latest ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini models, with support for LLMs, image models, and (most likely) video models soon.\n\nThe quality of the output really depends on the quality of the workflow you build, but AirOps makes learning easy. They offer helpful tutorials and frequently host webinars featuring well-known names in SEO and content marketing who share how they use the platform.\n\nIt’s not the cheapest tool, but it’s incredibly powerful — and I think its role across marketing teams will only grow as it continues to evolve.\n\nThe best AI sales tools\n-----------------------\n\n### [Attio](https://attio.com/)\n\nPlay\n\nAttio is an AI-powered CRM that’s been gaining traction with SMEs and startups. The big players like Salesforce and HubSpot are adding AI features too, and switching CRMs is notoriously painful, so why would anyone bother with Attio?\n\nThe short answer is: it’s just really nice to use. If you’ve spent any time in Salesforce, you’ll know how complicated CRMs can get. Attio feels modern, highly customizable, and intuitive — if you can use a spreadsheet, you can figure it out quickly.\n\nIt also comes with solid built-in data enrichment features, and they recently announced an integration with [Clay](https://www.clay.com/), which will beef up the platform's data enrichment capabilities further.\n\nThat said, it’s not perfect. I don’t think it’s quite ready for large sales teams with very complex processes, and the integration options are still limited (though expanding quickly). But if you’re part of a smaller, more agile team, Attio is definitely worth a look.\n\nAbout the author\n\n![Image 51](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65e89895c5a4b8d764c0d70e/65e89895c5a4b8d764c0f759_Ema.webp)\n\nContent Writer & Marketing Expert\n\nEma Lukan\n\nEma Lukan is a seasoned Content Writer and Marketing Expert with a rich history of collaborating with marketing agencies, SaaS companies, and film studios.

In my experience using these tools across work and personal projects, they stand out for their reliability, features, and ease of use.\n\n### Which AI tools are free to use?\n\nMany of the AI tools I featured offer generous free plans or trials. ChatGPT, Fathom, NotebookLM, Canva, and Suno all have free tiers with core functionality. Some even allow you to create full projects without needing to upgrade—great for testing before you commit to a paid plan.\n\n### What are the main types of AI tools?\n\nAI tools fall into categories like assistants (ChatGPT, Claude), video generation (Synthesia, Veo), image creation (Midjourney, GPT-4o), automation (n8n, Manus), and research (NotebookLM, Deep Research). I’ve grouped the top 45 tools into 20 categories to help you quickly find the right one based on your needs.\n\n### What is the most powerful AI tool right now?\n\nIn my experience, ChatGPT is still the most powerful all-around AI tool—especially the paid versions with GPT-4o. That said, if you’re looking for specialized power, Synthesia leads in video, ElevenLabs in voice, and Perplexity in research. The “most powerful” really depends on what you're trying to do.\n\n### What are the top 5 AI platforms for productivity?\n\nFor getting more done with less effort, these are my top 5 AI productivity tools:\n\n1.

Those interested in learning more about AI tools and how to effectively use them should consider one of the many educational offerings provided at USF. For Research-focused applications, the USF Workshops for Researchers cater directly to teaching AI toolsets and consider the attribution of AI-generated content. For teaching using AI tools, Innovative Education offers a GenAI Skills workshop to help instructors learn how to apply AI in their classrooms. \n\n#### Q. Is it wrong for me to use AI tools?\n\nA. As a whole, it is not inherently wrong for you to use an AI toolset. Keep in mind, that many of the foundations of AI toolsets have been used for years now (ex. machine learning), and have been largely ethically applied. The ethical dilemmas that exist currently are largely focused on where AIs source their training materials and those who try to misrepresent AI-generated content as their own original works. For use at USF in coursework, your faculty members must give the okay for AI usage. Separately, if you're developing research deliverables with AI, it's key to understand what your publisher's/conferences' stance on AI is. For questions on this, please contact LeEtta Schmidt, USF Libraries' Copyright and Intellectual Property Librarian, at lmschmidt@usf.edu. \n\n#### Q. What’s the difference between AI and Generative AI?\n\nA. *Artificial Intelligence* (AI) refers broadly to machines mimicking human intelligence. *Generative AI* (like ChatGPT or DALL·E) creates new content—text, images, or code—based on patterns in training data. Not all AI is generative, and understanding the distinction helps determine ethical and appropriate uses.\n\n#### Q. Which AI tools can I use for free?\n\nA. There are a variety of AI toolsets that are free to access. You can find several of these on our [Tools for Research page](https://guides.lib.usf.edu/c.php?g=1315087&p=9678775). While many of these offer premium versions that cost more, many are free to get started with. Keep in mind though, that user data is not made private within many of these applications as a result. \n\n#### Q. Can AI be detected in assignments and publications?\n\nA. While some platforms have claimed to be able to detect AI usage within submitted assignments/papers, none have been able to consistently prove it. As a result, USF as well as many other institutions have not been able to leverage their traditional plagiarism checkers to access AI written content. However, it should be noted, that AI-written content can often stray significantly from our own writing styles. Additionally, AI-written content is at risk of hallucinations or a limited knowledge base. Please keep this in mind as you both develop assignments for your students or as you develop your own research papers. \n\n#### Q. Should I credit an AI within my work if I leveraged one?\n\nA. In most circumstances, yes, the use of generative AI tools should be cited.  This is entirely contextual to the work you're completing. For generating emails and editing grammar, there is no need to credit an AI unless you're simply copying and pasting its response to an inquiry.  Remember that you are still responsible for all your communication even if it was generated by AI.\n\nFor presentations, assignments, and coursework the use of any generative AI tool must be approved by your faculty member.  If used in a publication, your publisher may expect you to attribute the AIs you’ve used. It is key to understand that AI cannot retain copyright, as human authorship has been deemed as the baseline for copyright. For more information, see our “[Citing Generative AI Resources](https://guides.lib.usf.edu/AI/citing?preview=6c157ee2e80f53328ebd62f2037dd763)”, “[Publisher Policies](https://guides.lib.usf.edu/c.php?g=1315087&p=9689256)” and “[Copyright and Generative AI](https://guides.lib.usf.edu/c.php?g=1315087&p=9690822)” pages.\n\n#### Q. Can I talk to my liaison librarian about covering AI in the classroom or should I ask someone else in the library?\n\nA. Yes, your liaison librarian and the Libraries’ AI topic specialists will be happy to speak on AI guidance during an instructional session. For research applications of AI tools, we recommended contacting Research and Instruction Librarian, [Evan Fruehauf](mailto:efruehauf@usf.edu), who can provide research and instructional support tied to AI usage. For Copyright and Attribution, we recommended contacting Copyright and Intellectual Property Librarian, [LeEtta Schmidt](http://lmschmidt@usf.edu), who can assist with any questions regarding best practices.  \n\n#### Q. Where can I find university policies about AI at USF?\n\nA. All policies on AI applications at USF can be found on the [USF Hub for Generative AI](https://genai.usf.edu/at-usf/university-guidance). Keep in mind, that current policy at USF enables faculty members to make the final call on whether certain technologies can be permitted for classroom usage. If not explicitly defined by your faculty members, it is not strictly allowed in all applications. Remember to stay transparent!\n\n* [**Next:** What is Generative AI? >>](https://guides.lib.usf.edu/AI/whatis)\n\n[Ask Us](#)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |"

According to [MIT Sloan Management Review and BCG’s joint research](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/winning-with-ai/ \"MIT Sloan Management Review and BCG’s joint research\"), seven out of ten companies have seen negligible returns from AI. The difference isn’t the technology—it’s the lack of a structured approach.\n\n[According to Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-29-gartner-predicts-30-percent-of-generative-ai-projects-will-be-abandoned-after-proof-of-concept-by-end-of-2025 \"According to Gartner\"), 30% of generative AI projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by 2025. Building a successful **AI implementation roadmap** requires a strategic framework that aligns technology with business objectives while managing risks effectively.\n\nThis guide walks you through a proven 6-phase framework for creating and executing an AI roadmap. You’ll learn how to assess readiness, select pilot projects, scale solutions, and measure success. Whether you’re leading enterprise transformation or introducing AI to a small business, this framework—refined through Space-O’s 15+ years as an [AI consulting company](https://www.spaceo.ai/services/ai-consulting/ \"AI consulting company\")—provides the structure needed to navigate your implementation journey.\n\n## What is an AI Implementation Roadmap?\n\nAn AI implementation roadmap is a strategic framework that guides organizations through the systematic adoption of artificial intelligence technologies. It serves as a comprehensive blueprint outlining the phases, milestones, resources, and timelines needed to integrate AI into business operations successfully.\n\nUnlike traditional IT project plans, an AI roadmap addresses unique challenges such as data readiness, model training, ethical considerations, and organizational change management. The roadmap typically spans 12-24 months for enterprise implementations and 6-12 months for smaller initiatives.\n\nCore components of a practical AI roadmap include assessment frameworks, pilot project selection criteria, scaling strategies, and success metrics. Each component builds upon the previous one, creating a logical progression from initial exploration to full-scale deployment.\n\nThe implementation of artificial intelligence requires this structured approach to manage complexity and minimize risks. Modern roadmaps also incorporate considerations for generative AI, MLOps practices, and continuous learning systems. By following an [AI development life cycle](https://www.spaceo.ai/blog/ai-development-life-cycle/ \"AI development life cycle\"), organizations can avoid common pitfalls and accelerate time to value. The roadmap becomes your single source of truth for all AI initiatives, guiding decisions from initial planning through deployment.\n\n## What are the 6 Phases of AI Implementation?\n\nThe journey from AI concept to operational deployment follows six distinct phases. Each phase builds critical capabilities while reducing implementation risks. Space-O has refined this framework through 200+ successful AI projects across industries.\n\nUnderstanding these phases helps organizations plan resources, set realistic timelines, and avoid common pitfalls.\n\n### Phase 1: AI readiness assessment\n\nThe assessment phase evaluates your organization’s current state across four dimensions: data maturity, technical infrastructure, team capabilities, and business alignment. This phase identifies gaps that could derail implementation later.\n\nKey activities include auditing existing data sources, reviewing the current technology stack, assessing team skills, and analyzing business processes. Organizations typically discover significant gaps in their AI readiness. The assessment deliverable is a comprehensive readiness report with a gap analysis matrix.\n\n**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks for small businesses, 4-6 weeks for enterprises. Budget allocation: 5-10% of total AI investment.\n\n### Phase 2: Strategy development and goal setting\n\nStrategy development transforms assessment findings into actionable plans. This phase defines specific use cases, success metrics, and resource requirements. The implementation phases must align with broader business objectives.\n\nStrategic planning involves prioritizing use cases by impact and feasibility, defining KPIs and success criteria, and creating a detailed project charter. Teams should identify 3-5 initial use cases and select 1-2 for pilot implementation. The strategy document becomes your north star for all subsequent decisions.\n\n**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks. Critical output: Strategic roadmap with prioritized use cases and resource plan.\n\n### Phase 3: Pilot project selection and planning\n\nPilot selection determines your first AI implementation success. The ideal pilot balances quick wins with strategic value. This phase involves detailed project scoping, team formation, and risk assessment.\n\nSelection criteria include data availability, business impact potential, technical complexity, and stakeholder support. Successful pilots typically address a specific pain point with measurable outcomes achievable within 3-4 months. The pilot project plan should include clear success metrics and fallback strategies.\n\n**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for selection, 1-2 weeks for detailed planning. Resource requirement: Cross-functional team of 4-6 members.\n\n### Phase 4: Implementation and testing\n\nImplementation transforms plans into working AI solutions. This phase encompasses data preparation, model development, integration, and rigorous testing. The roadmap template guides iterative development cycles.\n\nDevelopment follows agile methodology with 2-week sprints. Key milestones include data pipeline establishment, model training and validation, system integration, and user acceptance testing. Teams should expect 2-3 iteration cycles before achieving target performance metrics. Modern [machine learning techniques](https://www.spaceo.ai/blog/machine-learning-techniques/ \"machine learning techniques\") enable faster iteration and improved accuracy.\n\n**Timeline**: 10-12 weeks for standard implementations. Testing should consume 30% of implementation time. Consider using proven [AI development tools](https://www.spaceo.ai/blog/best-ai-development-tools/ \"AI development tools\") to accelerate development.\n\n### Phase 5: Scaling and enterprise integration\n\nScaling successful pilots requires careful orchestration of technology, processes, and people. This phase addresses infrastructure expansion, process standardization, and change management across the organization.\n\nScaling activities include infrastructure optimization, API development, security hardening, and multi-department rollout. Organizations must balance speed with stability. The implementation steps should include phased rollouts with continuous monitoring.\n\n**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks for initial scaling, ongoing for enterprise-wide deployment. Investment: 40-50% of total AI budget.\n\n### Phase 6: Monitoring and continuous optimization\n\nThe final phase establishes systems for continuous improvement. This includes performance monitoring, model retraining, and value realization tracking. Successful AI implementation requires ongoing optimization.\n\nMonitoring encompasses model performance metrics, business KPI tracking, user adoption rates, and ROI measurement. Organizations should establish MLOps practices for sustainable AI operations. Regular reviews ensure AI solutions continue delivering value as business needs evolve.\n\n**Timeline**: Continuous. Resource allocation: 15-20% of the AI operations budget annually.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Small businesses can compress Phases 1-3 into 6-8 weeks by focusing on a single, high-impact use case. Enterprise organizations should resist this temptation—thorough planning prevents costly mistakes at scale.\n\nSkip Months of Trial and Error\n\nYou’ve seen the framework. Now let Space-O’s AI consultants tailor it to your specific industry and goals. Get a personalized implementation plan in just 2 weeks.\n\n[Book a Free Consultation](# \"Book a Free Consultation\")\n\n## How to Conduct an AI Readiness Assessment\n\nA comprehensive AI readiness assessment examines four critical dimensions that determine implementation success. The assessment provides objective data about your organization’s preparedness and identifies specific gaps requiring attention before moving forward.\n\n### 1. Data readiness evaluation\n\nData forms the foundation of any AI initiative. Assessment begins with cataloging existing data sources, volumes, and quality metrics. Organizations must evaluate data accessibility, integration capabilities, and governance policies.\n\nKey evaluation criteria include data completeness (aim for >90%), consistency across sources, and historical depth (minimum 12-24 months). Space-O’s assessments reveal that many companies overestimate their data readiness.\n\nCommon issues include siloed databases, inconsistent formats, and missing documentation. The enterprise AI implementation roadmap must address data gaps before model development begins. Create a data quality scorecard, rating each source on completeness, accuracy, consistency, and timeliness. Prioritize remediation efforts based on pilot project requirements.\n\n### 2. Technical infrastructure analysis\n\nInfrastructure assessment evaluates current computing resources, storage capabilities, and integration platforms. Modern AI workloads require substantial computational power and flexible architectures.\n\nAssess cloud readiness, API availability, and security frameworks. Document current technology stack, including databases, analytics tools, and development platforms. Identify integration points with existing systems. Consider both on-premise and cloud deployment options.\n\nInfrastructure gaps often include insufficient GPU resources, limited API capabilities, and outdated data warehouses. Budget 25-30% of AI investment for infrastructure upgrades. Monitor infrastructure metrics including response latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Establish auto-scaling policies based on demand patterns. Our [AI tech stack](https://www.spaceo.ai/blog/ai-tech-stack/ \"AI tech stack\") guide details production architecture patterns.\n\n### 3. Team capability mapping\n\nSuccessful AI implementation requires diverse skills across data science, engineering, and business domains. Assessment maps current capabilities against project requirements.\n\nEvaluate existing skills in machine learning, data engineering, and domain expertise. Identify skill gaps and training needs. Consider build-versus-buy decisions for specialized expertise.\n\nMost organizations need 3-6 months to build adequate AI capabilities. Our[AI development team building guide](https://www.spaceo.ai/blog/build-an-ai-development-team/ \"AI development team building guide\") provides detailed role descriptions. Consider partnering with [AI consultants](https://www.spaceo.ai/hire/ai-consultants/ \"AI consultants\") to accelerate capability development.\n\n### 4. Business process alignment\n\nAI implementation must align with existing business processes and workflows. Assessment identifies integration points and change management requirements.\n\nMap current processes and identify AI enhancement opportunities. Evaluate stakeholder readiness and change appetite. Document regulatory and compliance requirements. Assess cultural readiness for AI adoption.\n\nCreate a heat map showing process complexity versus AI impact potential. Focus initial efforts on high-impact, low-complexity processes.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Use Space-O’s AI Readiness Assessment Template to systematically evaluate each dimension. Score each area on a 1-5 maturity scale. Aim for minimum Level 3 maturity before proceeding to pilot projects. Request our template through our consultation process.\n\n## How to Develop Your AI Strategy and Goals\n\nStrategic planning transforms AI potential into actionable business outcomes. This phase establishes clear objectives, success metrics, and implementation priorities. The ai implementation roadmap for small businesses differs from enterprise approaches in scope but not rigor.\n\n### 1. Defining business-aligned objectives\n\nAI strategy must directly support core business goals. Start by identifying top business priorities: revenue growth, cost reduction, customer experience, or operational efficiency. Map AI capabilities to these priorities.\n\nEffective objectives follow the SMART framework: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Examples include reducing customer churn by 20% within 6 months or automating 40% of routine inquiries by year-end. Each objective should have clear ownership and accountability.\n\nSpace-O recommends limiting initial objectives to 3-5 focused goals. Attempting too many simultaneous initiatives dilutes resources and reduces success probability. Document how each AI objective contributes to broader [enterprise AI development](https://www.spaceo.ai/services/enterprise-ai-development/ \"enterprise AI development\") goals.\n\n### 2. Selecting success metrics and KPIs\n\nMetrics selection determines how you’ll measure AI implementation success. Choose KPIs that balance technical performance with business impact.\n\nTechnical metrics include model accuracy, processing speed, and system uptime. Business metrics encompass ROI, productivity gains, and customer satisfaction scores. Leading indicators (model performance) predict lagging indicators (business outcomes).\n\nEstablish baseline measurements before implementation. Create dashboards tracking both technical and business metrics. Review metrics weekly during implementation and monthly during operations. Adjust targets based on actual performance data.\n\nAccording to [MIT Sloan research](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-ai-metrics-that-matter/ \"MIT Sloan research\"), organizations tracking both technical and business metrics achieve substantially better ROI from AI investments.\n\n### 3. Creating implementation timelines\n\nRealistic timelines balance urgency with thoroughness. The complete ai implementation roadmap steps typically span 6-18 months, depending on scope and complexity.\n\nBreak implementation into phases with clear milestones. Include buffer time for unexpected challenges (add 20-30% to initial estimates). Define go/no-go decision points between phases. Create dependency maps showing task relationships.\n\nSmall businesses can achieve initial results in 3-4 months with focused pilots. Enterprises should plan 12-18 months for comprehensive implementation, including scaling. Regular timeline reviews ensure projects stay on track.\n\n### 4. Resource allocation and budgeting\n\nAI initiatives require investment in technology, talent, and transformation. Budget allocation should reflect strategic priorities and expected returns.\n\nTypical budget breakdown: 30% for talent (hiring, training), 25% for infrastructure, 20% for software/tools, 15% for data preparation, and 10% for change management. Initial investments range from $50,000 for small pilots to $5+ million for enterprise initiatives.\n\nConsider the total cost of ownership, including ongoing operations. Plan for iterative funding releases based on milestone achievement.

Each challenge has proven solutions based on industry best practices and Space-O’s implementation experience.\n\n### Challenge 1: Data quality and availability issues\n\nPoor data quality remains the top AI implementation roadblock. Common issues include incomplete datasets, inconsistent formats, and insufficient historical data.\n\n**Solution:** Implement data quality frameworks before AI development begins. Establish data governance policies defining ownership, quality standards, and update procedures. Use automated data validation tools checking completeness, accuracy, and consistency. Create data pipelines with built-in quality checks. Best practices from [AI software development companies](https://www.spaceo.ai/blog/ai-software-development-companies/ \"AI software development companies\") emphasize iterative improvement over perfect initial deployments.\n\nAllocate 30-40% of the pilot timeline for data preparation. Consider synthetic data generation for rare events. Partner with data providers to fill gaps. The implementation of best practices reduces data-related delays by 50%.\n\n### Challenge 2: Skills gap and talent shortage\n\nThe AI talent shortage affects the majority of organizations attempting implementation. Skills gaps span data science, ML engineering, and AI operations.\n\n**Solution:** Develop hybrid talent strategies combining hiring, training, and partnering. Create internal AI academies for upskilling existing employees. Partner with universities for talent pipelines. Leverage [machine learning developers](https://www.spaceo.ai/hire/machine-learning-developers/ \"machine learning developers\") for specialized expertise.\n\nImplement mentorship programs pairing senior with junior talent. Use low-code AI platforms to reduce technical skill requirements. Focus on hiring for potential and training for specific skills. Consider fractional AI executives for strategic guidance. Review [top AI consulting firms](https://www.spaceo.ai/blog/top-ai-consulting-firms/ \"top AI consulting firms\") for strategic partnerships.\n\n### Challenge 3: Integration complexity with legacy systems\n\nLegacy system integration often consumes significantly more resources than anticipated. Challenges include outdated APIs, data silos, and architectural mismatches.\n\n**Solution:** Adopt API-first integration strategies using modern middleware platforms. Implement data virtualization to avoid direct system modifications. Create abstraction layers isolating AI systems from legacy complexity. Use a microservices architecture, enabling gradual modernization.\n\nPhase integration starts with read-only access before implementing write-back capabilities. Document all integration points and dependencies. Plan for parallel running during transition periods. Consider professional [AI integration services](https://www.spaceo.ai/services/ai-integration/ \"AI integration services\") for complex environments.\n\n### Challenge 4: Measuring and demonstrating ROI\n\nOrganizations struggle to quantify AI value beyond technical metrics. Traditional ROI models don’t capture AI’s transformative potential.\n\n**Solution:** Develop comprehensive ROI frameworks balancing short-term gains with long-term value. Track both hard metrics (cost savings, revenue increase) and soft benefits (customer satisfaction, employee productivity). Establish baseline measurements before implementation.\n\nUse value trees linking AI capabilities to business outcomes. Implement A/B testing comparing AI-enhanced processes with traditional approaches. The roadmap template should include ROI tracking mechanisms. Regular value assessments ensure continued investment support.\n\n### Challenge 5: Managing stakeholder expectations\n\nUnrealistic expectations about AI capabilities and timelines create disappointment and resistance. Media hype contradicts implementation realities.\n\n**Solution:** Establish realistic expectations through education and transparent communication. Create “AI art of the possible” workshops demonstrating actual capabilities. Develop phased delivery plans showing incremental value. Regular stakeholder updates maintain alignment.\n\nDocument assumptions and constraints explicitly. Use proof of concepts to set appropriate expectations. Celebrate small wins, building confidence. Space-O recommends monthly stakeholder showcases demonstrating progress.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Create an “AI Failure Recovery Protocol” before you need it. Document escalation procedures, rollback plans, and communication templates. Include decision criteria for pivoting versus persevering. Organizations with recovery protocols reduce failure impact by 60% and recover 3x faster.\n\n## Start Your AI Implementation Journey\n\nThe path from AI ambition to operational reality requires strategic planning, disciplined execution, and continuous optimization. Organizations following structured implementation roadmaps achieve significantly higher success rates and better ROI than those taking ad-hoc approaches.\n\nYour AI transformation begins with honest assessment, clear strategy, and committed leadership.

It finds that many government AI initiatives remain in pilots. It highlights common system-wide barriers – skills gaps, difficulties accessing and sharing high-quality data, limited actionable guidance, risk aversion, and weak measurement of results and return on investment. Other challenges vary by function, including inflexible or ambiguous regulation, high or uncertain costs, and outdated legacy information technology systems.\n\n### Key messages\n\n[Copy link to Key messages](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_795de142-en/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#title-bf8f2710ac)\n\n* The OECD’s review of AI use cases in government indicates a high presence of early-stage initiatives, such as experiments and pilots. This indicates:\n\n  + Possible challenges in transitioning from experimentation to implementation\n  + A need for increased monitoring and sharing of information\n  + A possible need for policy actions to encourage implementation and scaling.\n* Implementation challenges that are shared across all government functions are:\n\n  + Skills gaps\n  + Challenges to obtaining or sharing quality data\n  + A lack of actionable frameworks and guidance on AI usage, including for specific policy areas\n  + Risk aversion\n  + Demonstrating results and return on investment (ROI).\n* Government functions face a variety of other challenges, with some more prevalent in some functions than others:\n\n  + Inflexible or outdated legal and regulatory environments\n  + High or uncertain costs of AI adoption and scaling\n  + Outdated legacy information technology (IT) systems.\n\nGovernments face a variety of implementation challenges in adopting AI. Some of these challenges span all functions of government, while others appear more acute in certain ones. For instance, nearly all areas struggle with skills gaps and accessing and sharing quality data. AI implementation should account for distinct regulatory landscapes in different functions, with compliance requirements varying significantly between functions such as public procurement, law enforcement and tax administration. Additionally, some functions are more challenged than others with securing funding or with outdated systems, as only now are we seeing the emergence of digital infrastructure that share services with greater interoperability and integration. These challenges can translate into broader issues, such as difficulties in scaling up solutions and risk aversion that hinders innovation. This chapter discusses the various implementation challenges faced by functions of government, as further discussed as related to each function in Chapter 5. Many of these challenges mirror specific regional analysis on AI in government [(OECD/CAF, 2022[1];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kapp_1f334543_6aa383bb80) [Brizuela et al., 2025[2])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Bri25_6aa383bb80).\n\n### Most government AI efforts exist in exploratory or pilot phases, with limited scaling and documentation\n\n[Copy link to Most government AI efforts exist in exploratory or pilot phases, with limited scaling and documentation](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_795de142-en/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#section-d1e11445-6aa383bb80)\n\n#### Possible challenges in moving from experimentation to implementation\n\nThe OECD’s review of AI uses in government indicate a high presence of early-stage initiatives, such as experiments and pilots. This is consistent with discussions held among relevant OECD working parties and networks, in which government officials at both national and local levels report being in the early stages of using AI government, seeking to learn by starting small and testing different approaches.\n\nOverall, this approach is a good one. The OECD has long encouraged governments at both national and local levels to experiment with new approaches in a controlled and iterative manner to minimise risks and costs and to promote failures — which are inevitable — to occur quickly and generate lessons learned for future efforts [(OECD, 2017[3];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_g2g75c6c_6aa383bb80) [2024[4])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#OEC2417_6aa383bb80). This is critical, especially when first getting used to using AI, as some estimates suggest that more than 80% of AI projects fail, double the rate of non-AI projects [(Ryseff, De Bruhl and Newberry, 2024[5])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Rys24_6aa383bb80). For instance, a successful path to AI adoption can involve incorporating AI into low-risk areas and processes and using internally-generated or open data to demonstrate value and establish quick wins. An example of this case is the Finnish Government Shared Services Centre for Finance and HR (Palkeet), which began with modest applications of RPA, paving the way towards “hyper-automation” with machine learning (ML) (see Chapter 5, “AI in public financial management”).\n\nYet the end goal of most AI projects is the eventual implementation, and as appropriate, the scaling up of successful solutions. In many countries and functions of government, AI use cases largely exist in the exploratory phase (e.g. proofs of concept, pilot projects) and have not yet been more broadly implemented or scaled beyond limited use. For instance, in the United Kingdom (UK) — generally one of the more advanced governments when it comes to using AI — a report by the Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) [(2025[6])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#UKC25_6aa383bb80) found the government had “no systematic mechanism for bringing together learning from pilots and there are few examples of successful at-scale adoption across government”. The results of a Deloitte survey [(2024[7])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Aus241_6aa383bb80) in 14 countries reinforce challenges in scaling GenAI in particular, noting also this challenge is not unique to government. According to the survey, “a significant number of both commercial and government respondents have transitioned fewer than one-third of their GenAI experiments into full production”. This is attributed to other challenges discussed in this chapter: lack of expertise and difficulty in measuring mission value from GenAI.\n\nExisting data sources provide insights about the current state of AI adoption in government. For example, the use cases analysed for this report show most have moved beyond small pilots to be more fully implemented in some way. Of these implemented cases, most have not scaled beyond their original contexts (e.g. in certain offices or for certain processes) to address other needs. Although this is not always a goal, and AI uses in some government functions are often not appropriate for others. AI use cases in public service design and delivery in Chapter 5 demonstrate, however, that successful approaches can indeed be scaled up. In this report, the preponderance of implemented cases that go beyond pilots is in part due to a tendency for the OECD to select more implemented use cases because there is more public information available about them, and governments are somewhat more likely to report on them as part of OECD data collection exercises.\n\nOther data sources offer complementary perspectives. The Public Sector Tech Watch observatory of the European Commission (EC) has systematically collected AI uses cases for several years. Its data on nearly 1 500 AI use cases indicate that most AI solutions are still in the planned, pilot or in-development phase (58%), suggesting across the EU public sector the majority of cases remain experimental or not fully implemented ([Figure 3.1](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#figure-d1e11524-6aa383bb80)). Although moving from pilots to production appears to be a challenge — as reinforced in OECD discussions with governments — the proportion of implemented projects has increased in the latest data collections. This suggests that administrations may be transitioning their initiatives from initial testing to fuller implementation [(EC, 2024[8])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Eur241_6aa383bb80). This data does not consider the extent to which implemented projects have scaled beyond their initial context.\n\nThe “AI Systems in the Public Sector in Latin America and the Caribbean” database indicates a much higher proportion of implemented use cases (70%) [(Muñoz-Cadena et al., 2025[10])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Muñ25_6aa383bb80). However, this is likely due to the data collection for this database, which was built by researchers using publicly available information. Publicly available information may be less likely to include details on planned or piloted use cases compared to submissions from governments, which largely informed the OECD and EU databases.\n\nOverall, based on the OECD’s work on AI in government since 2019, including directly with many governments, it seems the expected state of implementation should be higher relative to early-stage testing. The high presence of early-stage cases would be easily explained if government use cases had a heavy emphasis on leveraging the latest AI technologies, such as generative AI foundation models. However, OECD research for this report indicates this is largely not the case; governments still tend toward more longstanding approaches. These observations suggest further work in this area is warranted to gain additional understanding about governments planning-to-implementation and scale-up journeys, and to derive more specific lessons learned and factors for success.\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, it may be possible that some narrow but traditional applications of AI — which may be more likely to be implemented or even scaled up — may have become so integrated or commonplace that they no longer trigger external reporting or a response to data collection efforts. This could skew the numbers through underrepresentation of implemented initiatives that do not rely on newer AI systems and approaches.\n\n#### Lack of evidence on continuity calls for increased monitoring\n\nAdditional information is required to gain a better understanding of the status and evolution of government AI use cases. Future research should investigate this further by monitoring the progression of solution development over time, which could generate lessons from both successes and failures. The OECD sought to explore the progress in relevant AI use cases discussed in previous products; however, there are generally few updated reports on the results of pilots or the status of implemented use cases, making it challenging to follow them in a longitudinal way. Most of the research done to determine whether a use case is operational relies on the ability to access a functional product (if public), or the presence of government press releases, news coverage, blog articles or public presentations. Another source is use cases shared through periodic public reports or official repositories, including those by the OECD. Current inventories or catalogues are often static; they depict projects as a snapshot in time, without providing insights into their development and evolution, and are often not updated. Primary data collection by researchers (i.e. directly surveying government organisations to further identify new efforts and obtain updates and lessons learned on known initiatives) would be useful for further research, though demands greater resources and time.\n\nThese challenges in accessing up-to-date information on individual use cases underscores the importance of governments’ monitoring of AI use cases, along with a systematic and regular sharing of information, which would further reinforce the OECD AI Principles on transparency and accountability. This would not only be valuable for external audiences; documenting and disseminating successful (and unsuccessful) methods and use cases can help government organisations to replicate and scale AI projects more effectively. This approach helps avoid common errors, helps ensure consistency and accelerates the adoption of AI technologies across various government entities [(OECD/UNESCO, 2024[11])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_421c1244_6aa383bb80). Inadequate or absent monitoring can also affect future use cases, as potentially effective AI innovations may be overlooked or, conversely, disproven approaches may be scaled up inappropriately. Further discussion and examples of how some governments are doing this can be found in Chapter 4, “Promoting transparency in how government uses AI”.\n\n#### Policy actions may be needed to encourage implementation and scaling\n\nThe fact that many AI initiatives are in the planning and pilot phases, or are unclear regarding their progression, suggests governments need to enhance their implementation capabilities to advance projects beyond initial testing stages, secure successful deployment and sustain long-term impact [(EC, 2024[8])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Eur241_6aa383bb80). This involves establishing foundational elements such as ensuring access to datasets, computing resources and the necessary expertise required to develop and scale AI projects. Such factors are discussed in-depth in Chapter 4. It also requires overcoming other implementation challenges, as discussed below.\n\n### Common challenges shared across core government functions\n\n[Copy link to Common challenges shared across core government functions](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_795de142-en/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#section-d1e11609-6aa383bb80)\n\n#### Skills gaps, the most common challenge\n\nA recent survey in five countries from Salesforce [(2024[12])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Sal24_6aa383bb80) found a lack of internal skills for using AI to be the primary barrier to government AI adoption, with 60% of public sector respondents highlighting this challenge.[1](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb802) Public sector respondents were a third more likely to indicate a skills gap in their organisation compared to the industry average. National-level reviews find comparable results, with 70% of UK government bodies reporting skills as a barrier to AI adoption [(UK NAO, 2024[13])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#UKN243_6aa383bb80). In a National Trade Union Study of 2 000 Australian Public Service (APS) employees from August to October 2024, 92% said they had received no training on using AI, and only 16% said they felt equipped to use the technology.[2](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb803) The Australian government has released and made available to all APS employees an AI in Government Fundamentals training module (in October 2024) and a series of MasterClass sessions on AI run by practitioners. The Australian Government has a number of capability building structures in place to enhance AI capability. The AI CoLab initiative provides a framework for cross-sector collaboration, codesign and regular events. Access to a government AI tool through a closed Beta Trial of GovAI commenced on 5 May 2025 with expanded access available to all APS employees on 31 August 2025.\n\nSkills gaps are also a significant challenge when focusing specifically on sub-national governments [(UN Habitat, 2024[14])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#UNH24_6aa383bb80). For instance, United States (US) surveys of state Chief Information Officers and local-level IT executives found that only 20% of state CIOs and 25% of local respondents were even slightly confident their technology workforce possessed the expertise necessary to respond to the advent of generative AI [(NASCIO, 2024[15];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#NAS24_6aa383bb80) [PTI, 2024[16])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Pub24_6aa383bb80). Beyond the commonly discussed challenge of governments competing with the private sector for talent, in some instances, national and sub-national governments are in competition with one another for the same limited talent pool. Smaller cities can also suffer from “brain drain”, with young talent moving to larger cities that provide more career possibilities [(de Mello and Ter-Minassian, 2020[17])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kapp_9582594a_6aa383bb80).\n\nSkills gap challenges can be seen across nearly all functions of government discussed in Chapter 5. Skills challenges limit governments’ ability to take advantage of the latest developments in AI and can contribute to reluctance among public servants to accept the use of AI in general. In several functions, governments are struggling to determine exactly what kinds of skills are needed, and for whom.\n\nSkills gaps can exacerbate other risks and challenges [(Trajkovski, 2024[18])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#CrossRef_Me6do734PDCmQpCMwph0Xw_6aa383bb80). For instance, they can lead to poor outcomes, the overestimation and misplaced trust in AI capabilities and systems, inadvertent misuse and general non-compliance with laws and other rules. Inconsistent levels of skill in governments can lead to pockets of innovation, but with little ability to scale beyond them.\n\nIn addition, a lack of skills internal in public administrations can result in an overreliance on outsourcing through public procurement [(Mitchell, 2025[19];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Mit_6aa383bb80) [Autio, Communigs and Elliott, 2023[20])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Chl23_6aa383bb80). While procurement is an important and normal aspect of obtaining AI-related goods and services, relying too heavily on procurement relative to building internal capacities can result in a hollowing-out of government capacities [(Trajkovski, 2024[18])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#CrossRef_Me6do734PDCmQpCMwph0Xw_6aa383bb80). This can form a vicious cycle, where governments lack the right skills to design upskilling programmes, understand which skills to recruit for, and fully understand vendor offerings to procure the right goods and services at a fair price. Overall, without proactive skills development, “public agencies will find themselves merely reacting to technological shifts rather than steering these emerging technologies to serve societal interests effectively” [(Trajkovski, 2024[18])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#CrossRef_Me6do734PDCmQpCMwph0Xw_6aa383bb80). If government cannot demonstrate efficient and effective use of and self-control of AI, then it is unlikely that it will be able to regulate the technology. This also contributes to the challenge of high costs for AI adoption, as discussed below; hiring contractors can cost three to four times as much per person as government employees [(UK DSIT, 2025[21])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#UKD25_6aa383bb80).\n\nSeveral governments have instantiated upskilling and targeted recruitment programmes (see Chapter 4, “Fostering skills and talent”), with some even using AI as a tool to achieve these goals (see Chapter 5, “AI in civil service reform”).\n\n#### Lack of high-quality data and the ability to share it\n\nThrough all levels of government and nearly every government function discussed in-depth in Chapter 5, data challenges are an impediment to developing and using AI in government. Recent work by RAND [(2024[5];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Rys24_6aa383bb80) [2025[22])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Rys25_6aa383bb80) found that data issues were one of the main drivers in failed AI projects, including a lack of suitable data, and noted the importance of work often perceived to have low “activity prestige” (e.g. data cleaning).\n\nFor some functions, the needed data may simply not exist or were never digitised from paper (e.g. as seen often in justice administration), or the quality of data available is deficient (e.g. poorly structured, incomplete or mistyped records, discrepancies in data formats). This can arise from a variety of reasons, including poorly controlled data input processes, or even previous lack of foresight that such data could someday be important. While time-consuming and burdensome, such quality issues can often be overcome, such as through digitisation, data cleaning and validation processes.\n\nThe repeated emphasis on a lack of sufficient, quality data may seem counterintuitive, as governments hold tremendous amounts of data and often make it available as open government data (OGD) to, among other things, help serve as inputs for training AI systems [(OECD, 2023[23])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_a37f51c3_6aa383bb80). However, in many cases, it is the ability for government agencies to share data amongst themselves that is a challenge. This can be due to rules that prevent sharing or are unclear to public servants, months-long approval processes, or less commonly, governments signing away data reuse rights in contracts with companies. These issues are also reflected when sharing data between jurisdictions and levels of government, adding challenges for AI adoption in subnational governments. Some countries are grappling with how to comply with data protection and management rules, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), though these data management issues generally existed long before such rules were put into force. In other cases, there is a lack of technical or policy protocols for sharing, or lack of interoperability across IT systems and data formats. In most cases, these issues are symptoms of a more systemic problem — inadequate data governance resulting in non-strategic, sporadic and fragmented data collection and management — and associated rules across government. Antiquated or burdensome rules around data sharing also contribute and may need to be reconsidered to account for technological advancements while still protecting privacy.\n\nOverall, it is critical that governments establish sound data governance and management activities to succeed in adopting AI — although only 59% of OECD countries have a data strategy in place for the public sector, with even fewer providing actionable guidance for implementation [(OECD, 2024[24])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_1a89ed5e_6aa383bb80). Without strong data governance in place, governments risk developing and deploying AI systems that use poor quality data, resulting in outcomes ranging from simple inaccuracies to systemic bias and unfair outcomes for citizens. Without robust data governance across organisations and levels of government, governments’ AI ambitions would largely need to be limited to the small experiments and pilots in limited settings that are the norm today, as discussed above.\n\nFostering the development of data-driven public sectors has long been a focus of the OECD [(2019[25];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_059814a7_6aa383bb80) [2023[23])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_a37f51c3_6aa383bb80), and a number of governments are putting in place the data foundations needed for governments to reap AI’s benefits (see Chapter 4, “Creating a strong data foundation”).\n\n#### Lack of actionable frameworks and guidance on AI usage\n\nNational strategies for AI in government — either dedicated strategies or those embedded in broader instruments — are now common, and they are important in defining a vision for AI success. However, they generally provide only high-level details on commitments and aspirations, offering limited concrete guidance to facilitate the materialisation of AI’s benefits while safeguarding against its risks. They also often fail to address key operational considerations that would make them effective. Investments and procurement, for instance, are often overlooked, despite being crucial for AI in government [(van Noordt, Medaglia and Tangi, 2023[26];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#CrossRef_AFmvUb9DbqqT8LaliP8hRw_6aa383bb80) [Monteiro, Hlacs and Boéchat, 2024[27])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_9aad76b7_6aa383bb80). To bridge this gap, governments need actionable guidance that is aligned to strategies and provides their institutions with tangible direction and assurances. Guidance is also important for sub-national governments, such as cities. This can be important for both ensuring alignment with national approaches — as sub-national governments often follow or take inspiration from national efforts — as well as for helping sub-national governments meet their own digital and AI ambitions as well as the needs of their citizens and residents.\n\nSuch guidance can be either boundary spanning, addressing system-wide issues to promote trustworthy AI adoption, or targeted, focusing on specific government functions and applications. Cross-cutting guidance provides clarity and direction for fundamental elements such as data governance, talent development and investment. Vertical guidance, in contrast, helps public servants navigate AI’s opportunities and risks via means effectively tailored to different policy domains. These approaches are not exclusive and can both be pursued complementarily.\n\nOverall, there is a lack of concrete cross-cutting and vertical guidance for AI in government. For instance, an inquiry by the Australian Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit [(2025[28])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Par25_6aa383bb80) — which does not necessarily reflect the views of the Australian government — found that while some government entities are starting to adopt AI, they lack guidance in doing so. It recommended that a whole-of-government working group be established to consider what rules and governance frameworks necessary for AI systems across the public administration. However, there are notable exceptions, such as the “AI Playbook for the UK Government” (Chapter 4, Box 4.2) and France’s structured approach to integrating AI in HRM (Box 5.19). Governments need to move beyond statements of intent to providing clear, practical guidance on AI adoption, investment, data governance, procurement and workforce development [(Morley et al., 2019[29])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#CrossRef_2dnEEMPP_GtgO3vLgLuKiA_6aa383bb80).\n\nThis gap is cited as a challenge in many functions of government in Chapter 5. Overall, a lack of guidance can contribute to risk aversion, as guidance can clarify uncertainty and reduce doubts among civil servants. The need for guidance has been raised specifically in the functions of regulatory design, public procurement, fighting corruption and promoting public integrity, and tax administration to address legal and governance uncertainties that leave public servants uncertain if and how they can use AI in these functions. In some instances, guidance is needed to clearly interpret laws and regulations and their practical application. In others, they provide clarity in situations where formal rules may not yet exist. Given sectoral variations, cross-cutting AI approaches need to be complemented by specialised guidance accounting for unique policy challenges, risk profiles and data landscapes. Governments will also need to keep in mind that AI is a rapidly evolving field, and such guidance should be flexible and will likely need adaptation and iteration to keep up with the pace of change.\n\nFurther discussion on government actions to overcome this challenge can be found in Chapter 4, “Establishing key governance mechanisms and processes” and “Using policy levers to guide trustworthy AI”.\n\n#### Driving innovation while mitigating risks\n\nOECD work last year [([30])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_26324bc2_6aa383bb80) found that when it comes to AI in government, governments tend to focus on the negatives (i.e. AI risks and how to mitigate them), but not so much on the positives (i.e. AI benefits and how to take advantage of them). This is not unique to governments’ approaches to internal AI activities. With regard to the broader economy and society, AI experts have found that government policy discussions and initiatives often recognise that AI may yield significant benefits, but government actions often do not explicitly target achievement of benefits. Rather, they indirectly address them through positive spillover effects when seeking to mitigate risks [(OECD, 2024[31])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_3f4e3dfb_6aa383bb80). These experts have urged governments to take more direct action to seize the opportunities presented by AI.\n\nMuch of this risk-oriented focus can be attributed to risk aversion, which has long hindered digital government and public sector innovation efforts, fostering a culture resistant to change in which failure should be avoided at all costs, including with regard to AI [(OECD, 2021[32];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_4e7c3f58_6aa383bb80) [2017[3];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_g2g75c6c_6aa383bb80) [2019[33];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_932780bc_6aa383bb80) [Desouza, 2018[34];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Des18_6aa383bb80) [SAS, 2020[35];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#SAS_6aa383bb80) [Richter, 2024[36])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Ric24_6aa383bb80). A survey from Deloitte [(2024[7])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Aus241_6aa383bb80) showed that 63% of public sector leaders believed GenAI would erode the overall level of trust in national and global institutions. This caution contributed to slower adoption of AI in government than in industry. Instances of risk aversion can be seen in several government functions in Chapter 5, especially in public procurement, fighting corruption and promoting public integrity. For instance, integrity institutions can be risk averse due to fear of making mistakes in the AI adoption process — with government guidance emphasising *what not to do* rather than the provision of actionable guidance on *how to* adopt AI in a trustworthy manner. Issues also arise as a result of over-correction in response to AI incidents, especially ones covered in media. Examples include instances when government chatbots provided misinformation or were hacked [(Hodges, 2024[37];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Hod24_6aa383bb80) [Fagan, 2024[38])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Fag241_6aa383bb80). Risk aversion is also a common topic of conversation when discussing AI in government in meetings of relevant OECD working parties and fora.\n\nGovernments should pursue one of the generally accepted best practices to AI development in use, such as considering the level of potential risk or impact that an AI system might have and developing tailored and commensurate measures to overcome potential adverse issues. Yet governments often seem to treat most AI efforts as if they were of a high level of risk or impact, requiring exacting requirements across the board and imposing cumbersome bureaucratic requirements, daunting to public servants seeking to innovate. This can serve as sufficient disincentive to prevent the process of exploration and can be seen in a study from Deloitte [(2023[39])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Mar231_6aa383bb80), which analysed all policy initiatives in the OECD.AI Database of National Policies & Strategies.[3](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb804) It found risk-weighted policies, which aim to shift from one-size-fits-all approaches to a data-driven and risk-based approach, were rare, representing 2% of initiatives in the database. The problem is also recognised in the April 2025 policy from the US on “Accelerating Federal Use of AI through Innovation, Governance, and Public Trust” [([40])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#USO25_6aa383bb80), which charges government agencies to “remove unnecessary and bureaucratic requirements that inhibit innovation and responsible adoption”.\n\nPublic servants can also develop “algorithmic aversion”. This is somewhat the opposite of “automation bias” discussed in Chapter 1, where “humans are reluctant to use algorithms despite their superior performance” [(Cheng and Chouldechova, 2023[41];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#CrossRef_x7Lqn9Sd36__OQtD4_ZJPJw_6aa383bb80) [Sunstein and Gaffe, 2024[42])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#CrossRef_Y69tmNQxo9MBHt_4DvBHxA_6aa383bb80), often after seeing mistakes in AI outputs. This suggests potential skills issues pertaining to the understanding of AI, its relative strengths and weaknesses and how to optimally use its outputs. It also suggests a lack of confidence in their abilities for human-machine collaboration as well as a lack of controlled environments for testing and safely experimenting with AI. These biases, which can distort perceptions of AI’s reliability, can be mitigated through structured interventions, such as trainings on AI’s strengths and limitations, as discussed further in Chapter 4 [(Featherson, Shlonsky and Lewis, 2019[43])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Fea19_6aa383bb80). Workers also need to feel they have a voice in inputs used for an AI system, and be able to use their professional judgement in how the outputs are used [(Dietvorst, Simmons and Massey, 2018[44];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#XRef_YNGOfqsvrSNbtCVbC0J3aA_6aa383bb80) [Cheng and Chouldechova, 2023[41])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#CrossRef_x7Lqn9Sd36__OQtD4_ZJPJw_6aa383bb80).\n\nThere is some evidence that risk aversion for AI in government may be receding as governments become more familiar with the technology. A recent study by Google Public Sector found that AI concerns among public IT leaders in the US over issues such as privacy and security are receding [(Teale, 2025[45])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Tea25_6aa383bb80). However, governments will need to be more active to overcome this risk-oriented focus to better consider trade-offs that better target opportunities. A variety of AI enablers and safeguards discussed in Chapter 4 can help divert from a culture of risk aversion and towards more controlled adoption and informed risk management.\n\n#### Demonstrating results and return on investment\n\nGovernments have made significant strides in implementing AI solutions across various public domains, demonstrating tangible benefits in efficiency, accuracy and service delivery. However, monitoring of progress and thorough retrospective evaluation of impact remain underdeveloped aspects of government AI implementation. While isolated cases of success are well-documented, as seen below, comprehensive efforts to assess AI's contribution to public value creation are often lacking. This can be seen in the case of the UK, where “only 8% of AI projects show measurable benefits and only 16% show forecast costs, making it difficult to assess these against a cost-benefits analysis” [(UK DSIT, 2025[21])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#UKD25_6aa383bb80). Specific to generative AI, a survey from Deloitte [(2024[7])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Aus241_6aa383bb80) in 14 countries shows that, despite anticipating increasing AI investments, 78% of government leaders surveyed report struggling to measure impacts from GenAI—significantly higher than those in other sectors, which poses a barrier to AI adoption and scaling even when other challenges, such as talent gaps, are resolved.\n\nA handful of AI solutions have demonstrated concrete, measurable results that illustrate the technology's potential to transform government delivery. These quantifiable results provide valuable benchmarks for understanding AI's direct impact on operational efficiency and service quality:\n\n* Peru's Amauta Pro AI system has transformed the speed at which courts can respond to victims of domestic violence. This AI-powered system has reduced the time needed to draft resolutions for protection measures from a lengthy 3 hours to 40 seconds. (see Box 5.63).\n* In the EU, DATACROS Project developed a tool to detect anomalies in corporate ownership structures that may indicate risks of corruption, money laundering and other financial crimes. In 2021, the predictive tool correctly identified 83% of companies targeted by sanctions and 88% of companies with sanctioned owners (see Box 5.27).\n* The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) developed an AI system to assess structural damage across areas affected by Hurricane Ian, which reduced the number of structures requiring human review from over 1 million to just 77 000. Within 72 hours of the hurricane’s landfall in 2022, FEMA had insights into the extent of damage across affected regions, enabling faster resource allocation and recovery planning. (see Box 5.58).\n\nParticularly notable are cases where AI systems have been explicitly compared against human performance, highlighting significant improvements in speed, scale and resource utilisation that exceed human capability. In Singapore, government agencies transformed hiring with AI tools available on the market, enabling one agency to process over 3 000 applications for its Management Associate Program efficiently, saving EUR 44 000 (equivalent) and over 150 days of staff productivity.[4](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb805) Comparisons with human performance are important because they focus on the key counterfactual that is needed for evidence-based decision-making. Further, they push for a deeper understanding of human performance, making it possible to unveil implicit assumptions and biases that affect human delivery.\n\nBeyond individual use cases, some governments have begun documenting AI's impact at organisational and national levels, revealing substantial financial benefits and operational improvements. These broader assessments help establish the cumulative value of AI investments across government functions. The Australian Taxation Office, for instance, reported that their AI approach combining real-time analytics, pre-filled forms, and anomaly detection systems helped protect approximately AUD 78.9 million in revenue across over 636 000 interactions with users in 2023-2024 (Box 5.5). Similarly, substantial results were observed in Austria with the activity of the Federal Ministry of Finance’s Predictive Analytics Competence Centre (PACC), which made it possible to analyse 6.5 million cases across income, corporate and value-added tax sectors as well as customs transactions in 2023 (Box 5.3). These analyses detected instances of false reporting in employee tax assessments and identified fraudulent activities, resulting in additional tax revenues of approximately EUR 185 million. Looking to the future, a recent study by The Alan Turing Institute [(2024[46])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#The242_6aa383bb80) on UK public services found AI could help automate 84% of the central government’s service-related transactions, saving an equivalent of approximately 1 200 person-years of work every year.\n\nDespite these successes, such considerations are rare, and governments face significant challenges in systematically monitoring AI’s progress and impact. One key barrier is the lack of well-defined measurement and evaluation frameworks that can assess AI’s contributions in a standardised manner. Many AI applications are integrated into complex administrative processes, making it difficult to isolate and measure their specific effects. Additionally, the challenge of benchmarking AI against human performance is compounded by the fact that many AI-enabled tasks would be infeasible or prohibitively time-consuming absent automation. There is also a limited understanding of the long-term impact of use of LLM’s on human cognition, and whether their consistent use impacts the creativity, critical thinking skills and productivity of those that use them.\n\nA final consideration is that different contexts may call for different methodologies. For instance, a theme of discussion at the latest OECD [(2024[4])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#OEC2417_6aa383bb80) Roundtable on Smart Cities was that cities need to explore different methodologies for measuring and evaluating success that align with their own objectives to allow them to set measurable goals. Some initial governments efforts to address these problems are emerging, such as the UK government publication on best practice for evaluating the impact of AI evaluation methods [(Frontier economics, 2024[47])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Fro24_6aa383bb80). The US [(2025[48])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#USO24_6aa383bb80) has also recently issued AI acquisitions policy that recognises government agencies need to be “safeguarding taxpayer dollars by tracking AI performance and managing risks”. Without robust monitoring mechanisms, governments risk wrongly estimating AI’s value, potential risks and missing opportunities for improvement.\n\nEstablishing effective impact measurement frameworks is crucial for ensuring AI investments deliver real value to public administrations and citizens. As governments allocate increasing resources to AI development and deployment, demonstrating a clear return on investment (ROI) will become imperative. Reliable retrospective impact assessment mechanisms can help policymakers make informed decisions about scaling AI solutions, optimising resource allocation and justifying further funding. Furthermore, impact assessment provides essential feedback for refining AI systems and approaches, enabling continuous improvement cycles. Documented outputs also facilitate knowledge sharing across government entities, helping to scale successful approaches and avoid repeating unsuccessful ones. Perhaps most importantly, transparent reporting on AI's impacts — both positive and negative — is essential for maintaining public trust and accountability as these technologies become more deeply embedded in core government functions and activities. Different evaluation methods are appropriate for each context, but governments should try and compare the implementation of AI to the situation of its absence. The OECD has produced guidance on choosing an evaluation approach based on a variety of key considerations [(Varazzani et al., 2023[49])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Var23_6aa383bb80).\n\n### Challenges that are somewhat less common or vary among government functions\n\n[Copy link to Challenges that are somewhat less common or vary among government functions](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_795de142-en/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#section-d1e12118-6aa383bb80)\n\n#### Inflexible or outdated legal and regulatory environments\n\nInflexible, outdated or otherwise inadequate (e.g. excessive, lacking) regulatory environments pose many challenges. Many functions face regulatory or legal restrictions in data access and sharing, as discussed above. Beyond this, there can be confusion about AI accuracy and whether inadvertent errors introduced through the use of AI could lead to non-compliance with regulations and other rules, such as in fiscal reporting. Complexity in regulations is also a factor. For instance, tax administration officials face highly complex laws around tax processes, contributing to them largely relying on classic rules-based approaches. These challenges are as common at the local level as they are in national governments [(OECD, 2024[4])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#OEC2417_6aa383bb80).\n\nSometimes, issues with existing regulation is not the challenge, but gaps in regulation that lead to confusion over what is acceptable with AI. This confusion can contribute to other challenges, such as risk aversion or the preference for the maintenance of one’s existing state of affairs [(Samuleson and Zeckhauser, 1988[50])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Sam88_6aa383bb80). For instance, because it is not specifically addressed in many countries, public procurement officials are often unclear on whether AI can be used in procurement processes, fearing that doing so could expose them to challenges from unsuccessful bidders or others who question the fairness of the process. This provides a general lack of incentive for change. Confusion also exists around whether using advanced AI systems, which are often highly capable but function in an opaque manner, can meet regulatory standards, such as International Standards on Auditing or evidentiary rules in the criminal justice system. In contrast, people may continue to operate without AI to forego these risks and also the benefits of AI use.\n\nRegulatory environments pose a unique challenge regarding regulatory design and delivery. Beyond rules that restrict AI use, regulators should also be cautious and avoid making frequent changes to regulations, and to how they are implemented and enforced. Regulated entities need a level of clarity and predictability so they comply with regulations in a manner that causes minimal disruption with business operations. Frequent regulatory shifts, even if based on quality AI-informed insights, can lead to a volatile regulatory environment, making it difficult for businesses to plan long-term strategies and for the public to stay informed about current laws.\n\nGovernments can overcome these challenges by ensuring regulations and other formal rules are up to date, agile and minimise ambiguity. There is some evidence that governments are moving in this direction, with Deloitte [(2023[39])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Mar231_6aa383bb80) finding adaptive regulation — shifting from a “regulate and forget” mode to a responsive and interactive approach — to be one of the most common type of policies tracked by the OECD.AI Policy Observatory. Further guidance that helps contextualise regulations in particular functions of government is also important. Discussion on how governments are doing this can be found in Chapter 4, “Establishing key governance mechanisms and processes” and “Using policy levers to guide trustworthy AI”.\n\n#### High or uncertain costs of AI adoption and scaling\n\nWhile AI adoption has the potential to reduce costs through enhanced productivity and efficiency, many government organisations struggle to make the initial financial investments to begin their AI adoption journeys, or to scale up use cases that prove successful. These costs can sometimes range from paying licensing fees per employee for service-based AI offerings, such as ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, to extensive development, customisation and support costs for more tailored or in-house solutions [(Shark, 2025[51];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Sha251_6aa383bb80) [Barrett and Greene, 2024[52])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Bar24_6aa383bb80). In the UK, a survey of government officials by SAS [(2025[53])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#SAS25_6aa383bb80) found cost and budget restrictions to be the main challenge (raised by 67% of respondents), closely followed by a lack of internal skills (63%). Despite the critical nature of funding for AI, the OECD [(2024[24])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_1a89ed5e_6aa383bb80) Digital Government Index (DGI) highlights that only 15% of OECD countries have an investment framework in place for public AI investments.\n\nChapter 5 cites financial challenges in adopting AI for several functions of government, including in regulatory design and delivery, public services, tax administration, fighting corruption and promoting public integrity, and civic participation. In some instances, financial challenges also relate to the costs of recruiting or procuring skilled talent, with skills gaps discussed as a separate challenge above. Functions like tax administration have also indicated the process for securing budgets in government is a challenge.\n\nThis challenge can contribute to the OECD finding that governments often seem stuck in exploratory and pilot phases, with limited scaling of successful solutions. For instance, tax authorities have told the OECD that conducting small pilots is inexpensive and easy, even with advanced systems obtained from the private sector. However, such costs can grow exponentially as AI offerings are implemented more broadly within organisations or scaled up across other parts of government. Costs are particularly high for purpose-built solutions, with a group of 10 countries focusing on AI in the Public Interest stating that “the barrier to scaling AI models has been assumed to be primarily the lack of availability and affordability of compute” [(France Élysée, 2025[54])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#The252_6aa383bb80).\n\nGovernments need to recognise that underinvestment in technology increases long-term costs and total costs of ownership [(UK DSIT, 2025[21])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#UKD25_6aa383bb80). Some governments are seeking to address these issues through targeted investments, as well as the provisioning of central services that help to ease the need for each agency to build or buy their own solutions. These can be seen in Chapter 4 under “Investing purposefully”, “Building out digital infrastructure” and “Creating spaces to experiment”. Some are also using open-source models or exploring smaller models that can be designed to respond to specific societal and community needs, requiring less computational power and data [(France Élysée, 2025[54])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#The252_6aa383bb80).\n\nAlthough the costs governments and Chapter 5 highlight tend to focus on are financial, it is useful for governments to keep in mind that not only monetary costs impact AI adoption and scaling. Psychological costs related to AI use can also impact the extent to which individuals use AI tools in their day-to-day work, even if the investments are made to make them available. These costs can include search costs — which occur when people are searching for information but encounter outdated information, unclear language or confusing requirements — or cognitive costs, the mental resources people expend understanding complex information [(Shahab and Lades, 2021[55])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Sha01_6aa383bb80). “Sludge audits” are structured behavioural assessments of a decision-making process which aim to identify, prevent and reduce unnecessary frictions and psychological costs, which prevent people from taking actions they would otherwise take [(OECD, 2024[56])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#OEC242_6aa383bb80). By conducting sludge audits on the use of AI tools, governments can understand and address the barriers to acceptance that may limit AI adoption and scaling.\n\n##### Governments can lack clarity on how much AI development and use can or should cost\n\nThe challenges discussed above are most relevant when such costs are known. Governments have reported to the OECD that there is often uncertainty or confusion about how much the development or use of different types of AI systems could or should cost. This makes it difficult for public institutions to plan effectively and evaluate vendor offerings when considering public procurement to source solutions. Gaining clarity on these costs can help ensure governments are prepared to adopt AI systems in a strategic and sustainable way. Yet, the OECD could identify no research discussing cost for the development or use of different types of AI systems in government. This suggests an optimal area for further research and analysis. Still, understanding costs in a broader sense or from specific government AI projects can help governments arrive at estimates for planning purposes. This section aims to take the first steps in helping governments do this, with the potential for more in-depth OECD work on this topic in the future.\n\nThe cost of adopting AI can vary significantly depending on the type of system and its scale of use. For instance, governments can pursue a variety of options in adopting AI, such as those touched on below.\n\n###### Licensing private sector tools with fixed pricing per user or license\n\nCompanies offering AI tools often charge per user. This is the case for services such as Microsoft 365 Copilot, OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude. Licenses for these services can be purchased at the enterprise level, with prices ranging between USD 30-100 per user per month. The enterprise version Microsoft 365 Copilot costs USD 30 per month, for example.[5](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb806) Thus, a government running a pilot project comparable to Australia’s six-month pilot of 7 600 staff across 60 agencies [(2024[57])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Aus_6aa383bb80) could estimate costs to be around USD 1.37 million for licenses alone; that does not include additions such as staff time for pilot administration and reporting results, as well as other overhead. For Australia’s pilot, the Australian Treasury [(2025[58])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Aus25_6aa383bb80) estimated the license fee could pay for itself for a mid-level government staffer if it mitigated 13 minutes of their time per week for higher-value tasks. ChatGPT Enterprise costs are not published on OpenAI’s website, although when asked, ChatGPT suggested a cost of USD 60-100 per user per month, varying based on volume and features. Anthropic’s Claude Enterprise Plan pricing also depends on business needs and characteristics. While the prices are not available on Anthropic’s website, third-party websites estimate a cost of USD 60 per person per month.[6](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb807)\n\n###### Using private sector generative AI systems with volume-based pricing, such as tokens\n\nGenAI systems are often offered through volume-based pricing, where the volume is calculated through API traffic. Whereas provision through licenses is more relevant when public servants use the AI tools directly (e.g. using Copilot to help draft documents), volume-based pricing is more relevant when governments build internal or public-facing services that interface with a proprietary model, or when they want to customise (i.e. fine-tune) the content the model considers or how it produces outputs. The main functions of the price include:\n\n* Input tokens: tokens included in a prompt, such as instructions, context or data sent to the model.\n* Output tokens: tokens generated by the model in response to an input.\n* Training tokens: data (e.g. chunks of text) that an AI model learns from during training.\n\nModels see data as tokens, not sentences or paragraphs. The cost of tokens depends on the company and may be based on the level of complexity and resources needed for an individual model. For instance, the costs for some commonly use models are in [Table 3.1](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#tablegrp-d1e12331-6aa383bb80).\n\n### Table 3.1. Costs for 1 million tokens on common Generative AI models (USD)\n\n[Copy link to Table 3.1. Costs for 1 million tokens on common Generative AI models (USD)](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_795de142-en/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#title-be081524a9)\n\nOne million tokens represent approximately 750 000 words, 100 000 lines of code, 11 hours of transcribed audio speech, or 1 hour of transcribed video\n\n| **Model** | **Input tokens** | **Output** | **Training (if applicable)** |\n| **OpenAI GPT-4o** | USD 2.50 | USD 10 |  |\n| **OpenAI GPT-4o** (if fine-tuning to customise) | USD 3.75 | USD 15 | USD 25 |\n| **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo** | USD 0.50 | USD 1.50 | USD 8 |\n| **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro** | USD 1.25 | USD 10 |  |\n| **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** | USD 0.10 | USD 0.40 |  |\n| **Mistal Large 24.11** | USD 2 | USD 6 | USD 9 |\n| **Mistral NeMo** | USD 0.15 | USD 0.15 | USD 1 |\n\nNote: As of 10 April 2025. The inference costs for using a particular model or its equivalent tends to decrease over time [(Stanford HAI, 2025[59])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Sta25_6aa383bb80).\n\nSource: <https://openai.com/api/pricing>, <https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing>, <https://mistral.ai/products/la-plateforme>, <https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them>, <https://prompt.16x.engineer/blog/code-to-tokens-conversion>, <https://prompt.16x.engineer/blog/code-to-tokens-conversion>, <https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024>.\n\nFurther, some companies are offering foundation models through specific tiers dedicated to government agencies.[7](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb808) These services seek to meet governments’ stringent security standards. Further, they aim to be tailored to the needs of governments, providing solutions that make it easier to manage their own security, privacy and compliance requirements, as well as enable them to use the services for activities that may fall outside the standard usage policies.\n\nThe experiences of one central government AI lab in pursuing this approach is discussed in [Box 3.1](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#boxsection-d1e12559-6aa383bb80). Proprietary models can also be used in concert with open-source models, as touched on below.\n\n### Box 3.1. Government AI lab’s experience using proprietary AI\n\n[Copy link to Box 3.1. Government AI lab’s experience using proprietary AI](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_795de142-en/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#title-35aa913c00)\n\n#### Operations and expenses\n\nA central government AI lab in one county follows a phased approach to exploring, piloting and scaling AI projects for use in the public sector by civil servants. Overall, there may be as many as 100 projects being considered, around 15 undergoing limited testing, and around five to seven accessible to real users for a pilot or full deployment.\n\nThe lab uses cloud hosting and AI from Azure OpenAI, Vertex AI (Google), and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has a budget of around EUR 17.5 million. All work is conducted in-house. Most of its expenses are staff costs, including roughly:\n\n* 15 full-time equivalent staff (FTE) for technical talent (seven for development and AI engineering, four for design and user research, four for cloud/infrastructure).\n* Six FTEs for delivery management, which is critical for ensuring technical talent can focus on technical challenges, while delivery managers focus on addressing challenges regarding policy and bureaucracy.\n* Six FTEs for impact analysts who use data science to study project results and impact.\n\nIts largest deployed project has around 4 000 users, with around eight FTEs working on it. Other projects are smaller, with some having one or two FTEs. Overall, the lab’s products have around 10 000 monthly users. The total costs for AI cloud services, including tokens, are around EUR 3 500 per month.\n\n#### Lessons learned\n\n* The first few projects are by far the most expensive and time consuming, with significant investments in setting up cloud infrastructure and deployment templates that can be easily re-used for future projects. Deployments that took three weeks each for the first few projects now take 30 minutes.\n* Having robust cloud infrastructure in place is important, optimally shared among projects to promote synergies.\n* The lab considered the pros and cons of using proprietary AI models versus custom deployments of open-source models (e.g. Meta’s Llama). It determined volume-priced proprietary models to be more effective because civil servants tend to use the AI systems from 9:00-18:00. For a custom deployment, they would need to pay for GPU usage all day, even when the models are not being used. Overall, token-based pricing was less expensive for their needs. In addition, this approach allows the lab to spin-up new model instances more quickly and easily. For instance, it can deploy a new GPT-4.1 model in around five minutes, whereas custom deploying an open-source model could take weeks of infrastructure work.\n\n  + Overall, the lab estimated it would have cost EUR 9 300 per month to self-host host a Llama model, where they current spend around EUR 3 500 for tokens.\n* As usage of the lab’s AI tools has grown, the lab is reaching the limits of what cloud providers are willing to provide in terms of pay-as-you-go pricing. As their usage continues to increase, they face the choice of either 1) purchasing GPU capacity from the cloud providers, or 2) self-hosting open-source models and paying for GPU access directly (as mentioned in the previous bullet). For the lab, option 1 may be optimal because it still allows for rapid deployment.\n* The cost of developing AI, in terms of both technical resources (e.g. cloud services, tokens) and human resources is decreasing rapidly. The lab is finding that they can increasingly use AI to build AI, potentially changing labour demands. The implications for this have yet to be determined.\n\nSource: OECD interview with officials from an undisclosed country on 18 April 2025. The OECD is not publishing the name of the country or lab because of the preliminary nature of the estimates and analysis.\n\n###### Developing narrow, purpose-built custom ML applications (either in-house or procured)\n\nNarrow AI systems tailored for specific public-sector tasks can range from relatively small expenses to multi-million-dollar projects**.** These systems involve ML approaches developed for a specific use case, such as fraud detection, traffic optimisation or document classification. Simple pilots might be built for a few thousand dollars, whereas complex national systems can cost millions or tens of millions (USD), especially if scoping in defence applications [(Barnett, 2020[60])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#JAI20_6aa383bb80). As one example, the South Australian government is piloting four AI-enabled cameras aimed at cutting traffic congestion by analysing congestion and adjusting traffic light cycles at a cost of USD 218 000 (equivalent) [(Jackson, 2025[61])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Jac25_6aa383bb80).\n\nHowever, costs vary widely depending on complexity and context, and additional costs may be needed for data preparation, infrastructure and ongoing monitoring and maintenance. Because approaches and associated costs vary significant depending on the use case, it is difficult to provide estimates beyond these examples. Further analysis may be warranted to consider different aspects of such use cases and what different governments around the word have paid for them.\n\n###### Developing systems using pre-trained open-source models\n\nCompared to the custom development and training of a GenAI model, discussed below, pre-trained open-source AI models (such as Meta’s Llama models) can offer reduced costs with government still able to highly customise the model to meet their needs.[8](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb809) Open-source models can be self-hosted either on the cloud or on-premises, offering governments greater control over their data and long-term cost efficiency. While leveraging a pre-trained open-source model can reduce training costs to those incurred for fine-tuning, still other remaining costs can be significant. For instance, self-hosting eliminates recurrent fees for tokens or licenses, but it requires significant upfront investment in hardware and infrastructure, cloud resources, energy consumption, and maintenance and support costs.\n\nDespite the higher initial investment compared to licence or volume-based pricing, some governments have found that self-hosting can be cost-effective at scale and unlock use cases not feasible to them through commercial APIs (e.g. sensitive intelligence tasks, always-on local services, or offline operations in critical infrastructure). For instance, Chinese Taipei invested USD 7.4 million to develop its own foundation model called Trustworthy AI Dialogue Engine (TAIDE), which uses Meta’s Llama open-source models [(Creery, 2024[62])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Cre24_6aa383bb80).[9](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb8010)\n\nGovernment use of the open-source platform Polis (Box 5.36) represents a narrower use of open-source AI than the TAIDE efforts to develop a foundation model. One government organisation that built a customised and self-deployed version of Polis for a large-scale public engagement campaign, consisting of 33 regional and national Polis discussions with 30 000 participations, incurred overall costs of around EUR 422 500 over a 14-month period.[10](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb8011) These expenses consisted of EUR 195 000 for expert web development, cloud services and an outsourced user experience (UX) co-design sprint, and EUR 227 500 in staff time to implement Polis into the organisation’s existing workflows and to coordinate and conduct civic engagement activities. The same organisation has since invested EUR 200 000 in further enhancing their Polis application, split 50/50 between technical and staff costs. This enhancement work included user interface (UI) design and implementation and other technical development work, which have been open sourced for other Polis users. Overall, the organisation estimates that two full-time equivalent staff (FTE) is sufficient to manage the work, with a mix of expertise needed (such as technical development, project management, UX design and digital participation).\n\nOpen-source models can also be used in conjunction with proprietary models. For instance, one of the virtual assistants discussed in Chapter 5 uses both Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash and a Llama model from Meta, with the chat interface and orchestration of the two models developed in-house using open-source technologies.[11](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb8012) The system is being piloted with 18 000 users, with the main costs being associated with the use of the Gemini LLM and cloud web hosting for the chat application. While the LLM platform costs the government around EUR 18 000 per month, they expect a substantial reduction as they understand how to use the model most efficiently. The web hosting costs around EUR 2 300 per month. Overall, they estimate their costs at EUR 0.93-1.55 per user per month. Officials are in early discussions to scale the pilot up in other departments. The development and coordination team consists of approximately 10 FTEs.\n\n###### Developing custom GenAI models built and trained from scratch\n\nDeveloping custom built and trained GenAI models is generally the most expensive option (for comparable performance) due to high initial investment and operational complexity. Costs of training an LLM depend on model size (larger models with more parameters require more computational power and consume more energy), the quality and quantity of the training data (influencing the cost of data acquisition and curation), choices of infrastructure (whether training occurs on premises or cloud based), and the efficiency of training algorithms used.\n\nAI companies often do not publicly disclose the training costs associated with their models, although researchers estimate that current popular models cost around USD 41-192 million [(Stanford HAI, 2025[59])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Sta25_6aa383bb80). With the cost of training state-of-the-art models increasing two- to threefold each year, some research estimates that training the largest models may cost over EUR 1 billion by 2027 [(Cottier et al., 2024[63])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Cot24_6aa383bb80). While these costs can seem high, they can pale in comparison to the significant research and development investments, staff costs and data gathering efforts needed to achieve the latest foundation models [(Stanford HAI, 2025[59])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Sta25_6aa383bb80). Leading AI companies also have other prerequisites for developing such models, such as deep technical talent, and often, strategic partnerships with other companies.\n\nYet governments do not necessarily need to embark on building such extensive and powerful systems that seek to beat market competitors. Training from scratch of government-funded LLMs, for instance, can require fewer staff and cost resources, especially for those with fewer parameters or seeking to maximise relevance for a specific country, region or language. For instance, OpenEuroLLM has a total budget of EUR 37.4 million, implying a fraction of this sum will be dedicated to training its foundation model with another fraction for staff [(EC, 2025[64])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#EC251_6aa383bb80).[12](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb8013) In another example, one European country custom developed and trained an LLM in the national language, with the total cost, including personnel, coming in around EUR 500 000, of which EUR 300 000 was dedicated to GPU usage.[13](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb8014) Another example is GPT-NL in the Netherlands, which is investing around EUR 13.5 million provided by the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate (EZK) to train a model [(2023[65])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Gov232_6aa383bb80). Other efforts have been undertaken in in Japan, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and the United Arab Emirates [(Chavez, 2024[66])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Cha24_6aa383bb80). The collaboratively developed BigScience Large Open-science Open-access Multilingual Language Model (BLOOM)[14](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#endnote6aa383bb8015) involved significant contributions from government agencies. The project was primarily led by Hugging Face and the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), supported by a public compute grant on the French public supercomputer “Jean Zay”. The estimated cost of training is USD 2-5 million.\n\n#### Outdated legacy information technology systems\n\nMany governments’ AI ambitions are slow to materialise because of outdated legacy IT systems not suitable for AI development or use, or inadequate to manage and exchange large amounts of quality, interoperable data [(Irani et al., 2023[67])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#CrossRef_q3kACOijmppoio03I9PZjw_6aa383bb80). Such systems can result in significant missed opportunities. For example, in the UK alone, “taxpayer funded services from the NHS to local councils are missing out on GBP 45 billion in productivity savings — more than enough to pay for every primary school in the UK for a full year — because they are too often dependent on old and outdated technology” [(UK DSIT, 2025[68])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#UKG251_6aa383bb80). The government [(2025[21])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#UKD25_6aa383bb80) estimates 28% of central government IT systems are outdated, reaching 70% in some organisations, and 57% of UK government officials surveyed by software company SAS [(2025[53])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#SAS25_6aa383bb80) cited legacy systems as a barrier to AI adoption. The issue has also been raised by the UK PAC [(2025[6])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#UKC25_6aa383bb80) as an impediment to the use of AI in government.\n\nChapter 5 discusses how outdated legacy technology impacts AI adoption. For instance, the potential for AI in public financial management is limited by outdated financial management information systems in governments around the world, with such systems exceeding a decade old in most OECD countries [(Rivero del Paso et al., 2023[69];](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Lor23_6aa383bb80) [OECD, 2024[70])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Kappa_ce8367cd_6aa383bb80). Despite the significance of the challenge, considerations and analysis for legacy technology’s adverse effects in AI adoption appear light in most countries and government functions. While the previous paragraph includes significant detail about the scale of the challenge in the UK to illustrate the point, this is largely because most other governments have not conducted the analysis necessary to articulate the problem in such a manner.\n\nThis challenge is dependent on others, including the significant costs of funding the remediation of legacy systems. Outdated legacy technology also contributes to other challenges, such as data issues and an “overreliance on contractors sending costs rocketing”, including to maintain outdated systems, with “maintenance of legacy systems costing often three to four times that of modern alternatives” [(UK DSIT, 2025[68])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#UKG251_6aa383bb80). These expenses could be better placed in innovation and modernisation efforts.\n\nGovernments are taking a variety of measures to modernise their systems to be more AI-ready. In a novel instance, the US Department of Defence is using AI to modernise legacy code [(Harper, 2024[71])](/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html#Har24_6aa383bb80). More traditionally, some governments are providing targeted funding for modernisation efforts (see Chapter 4, “Funding AI and supporting coherent investments across government”).\n\nTo overcome the implementation challenges outlined in this chapter, as well as mitigate the risks outlined in Chapter 1, governments can turn to policy. Indeed, some governments are already doing so. The following chapter looks at policy measures governments can take — and actions some are already taking — to deliver AI that is trustworthy and to benefit from AI’s full potential.\n\n[7] Austin, T. et al.

This workshop brought together three industry practitioners to explore the strategic foundations of AI implementation: governance as competitive advantage, practical deployment strategies, and real-world applications. The insights shared provide an actionable playbook for executives navigating AI transformation while building sustainable competitive advantages.\n\n**Key Finding:** Innovation without guardrails is expensive chaos. Research and practical experience demonstrate that successful AI implementation depends not on the sophistication of the technology, but on the quality of governance frameworks, implementation strategies, and cultural transformation that accompany technological adoption.\n\n## Workshop Framework: The Three Pillars of AI Success\n\n### Opening Remarks: The AI Reality Check\n\n**Ainara Senra, Workshop Moderator and Executive Search Consultant, LYC Partners**\n\n\"Welcome everyone to what might be the most honest conversation you'll have about artificial intelligence this quarter. I'm Ainara Senra, executive search consultant at LYC Partners, and I'm here because of what we've been hearing in boardrooms across Asia over the past few months.\n\nIf you're joining this session, you've probably seen the dramatic shift in artificial intelligence capability in 2025. We're no longer in an experimental or theoretical phase with AI—it's already here, transforming industries from banking and manufacturing to consulting and technology.\n\nBut here's the reality: if you've actually tried to implement AI in your organization, you know it's not as simple as the headlines suggest. It's messier. In our conversations with executives across industries, the mood is a mix of anxiety, hype fatigue, and frustration.\n\nMany have invested in AI pilots that promised the world but delivered little more than flashy dashboards. Others find themselves stuck with tools that don't fit their actual workflows. There's a growing disconnect between AI's promise—faster processes, smarter decisions—and what actually lands in day-to-day business operations.\n\nToday, we're not promising you the most transformative hour of your life, but we can offer a candid look at what's actually working and what isn't. We'll explore three interconnected areas: governance foundations with Benoit's expertise, strategic implementation with Alex's framework, and practical applications through Kevin's real-world case study.\n\nThe goal isn't just to avoid another failed AI pilot, but to position your organization to capture real value from artificial intelligence. Let's begin with perhaps the most overlooked but critical foundation: governance as your competitive advantage.\"\n\n## Part I: AI Governance as Competitive Advantage\n\n**Benoit Larouturrou, EU AI Policy Expert and Regulatory Strategist**\n\n### The Governance Reality: Beyond Compliance Thinking\n\n\"Thank you, Ainara, and thank you for having me. I've spent 20 years in the rooms where AI policies are drafted—at the European Commission, in national ministries, and in boardrooms of companies facing these challenges. Today, I want to share insights that go beyond what's written on paper.\n\nLet's be direct: the European regulatory landscape for AI isn't designed rationally. To master any system, you must understand how it really works. EU AI regulations are driven by three powerful underlying forces:\n\n**First, transatlantic alignment.** This guides Europe to align with broader tech governance models and is the most important driver at institutional levels.\n\n**Second, absence of large-scale AI champions.** Europe has no major AI players, creating a system inherently designed to protect, not enable. The rules function as new trade barriers.\n\n**Third, cultural preference for precaution.** The European mindset regulates based on theoretical ideas and objectives—the fundamental opposite of 'move fast and break things' innovation.\n\nThese three pillars create scrutiny for anything developed under different governance models. So how do you compete when the rules themselves are barriers?\"\n\n### The Two-Europe Strategy: Theater vs. Reality\n\n\"This reality creates the most strategic imperative: you must learn to operate in two different Europes simultaneously.\n\nOn one side is the **theater in Brussels**—the paper barrier. This is the world of policymakers, NGOs, and media debating abstract principles and political compromises. They're paid to talk, so they will talk. Your goal here is efficient, effective compliance. Get your passport stamped and go through customs—don't waste time arguing with the border officer.\n\nOn the other side is the **real economy**—German engineering firms, French logistics companies, Finnish hospitals. I live in Europe and work with these organizations. Each needs solutions that make them better, cheaper, faster. Your goal here is delivering compelling value so the market advocates for you.\n\nWhere should 80% of your energy go? Absolutely on the ground level. Deliver value so compelling that if you win the market, the theater is forced to listen. Ground-level demand is the most powerful lobbyist.\"\n\n### Building the Trust Bridge: Three Strategic Pillars\n\n\"How do you execute this? Build what I call a 'trust bridge' with three pillars:\n\n### Pillar 1: Value Story Foundation\n\n**Stop selling 'AI this, AI that' technology.** Sell obvious solutions to European business problems. 'Our system reduces supply chain costs by 20%' or 'Our tool cuts energy consumption by X%.' Focus on tangible value, not abstract ideology that might trigger regulatory fears.\n\n### Pillar 2: Strategic EU Talent Investment\n\n**This is non-negotiable.** Whatever you say will be better heard if delivered by someone the audience feels familiar with. Hire senior, credible EU talent—not just lawyers, but operational experts who can navigate unwritten Brussels rules. These individuals are cultural translators and embodiments of trust, preventing fatal mistakes and opening doors that remain closed to outsiders.\n\n### Pillar 3: Regulatory Process Engagement\n\n**Stop being a rule taker; become a rule shaper.** Participate in think tanks, industry alliances, provide commentary on draft regulations. Build relationships with national regulators. This allows you to influence rules before they finalize and prevent the finish line from moving as you race toward it.\"\n\n### Success Case Study: NIO's Regulatory Jujitsu\n\n\"NIO exemplifies mastering this game. Facing the same barriers others struggle with, they understood what others missed. Their problem was market access; their solution was brilliance.\n\nThey bypassed EU political debate by certifying to stricter, globally respected standards. That quality and safety mark was recognized beyond and within Europe, allowing marketing campaigns focused on world-class safety and premium positioning rather than 'meeting EU compliance rules.'\n\nThey backed this with local European hires for trust and credibility. Result? They didn't just enter European markets—they're winning in key markets across Europe by turning regulatory hurdles into competitive marketing advantages.\"\n\n### The Global Launchpad Strategy\n\n\"The ultimate prize isn't just European revenue or market entry. Use Europe's well-debated framework as a global launchpad. EU-compliant certification becomes a powerful trust mark worldwide—in Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East where regulations are inspired by EU rules.\n\nThis isn't about overcoming European barriers; it's about making strategic investments today to build bridges that become global competitive advantages, actively future-proofing your company for the next decade.\"\n\n### Strategic Action Framework\n\n\"The path is clear:\n\n1. **Reframe your narrative** around undeniable value creation\n2. **Invest in European talent and faces** to build trust and navigate landscapes\n3. **Engage strategically** to shape the regulatory environment itself\n\nThis moves you from frustration to leadership, building bridges that competitors might be afraid to cross.\"\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Governance isn't a compliance burden—it's your competitive advantage when you understand the real rules and play the game strategically.\n\n## Part II: Strategic AI Implementation Framework\n\n**Alex Liu, AI Implementation Specialist and Consulting Director, LYS**\n\n### The Implementation Reality: Why 95% Fail\n\n\"Thank you for the invitation from Kevin and LYC Partners. Today my topic is leveraging AI in companies: why, what, and how.\n\nThere's significant anxiety around AI topics, recently emphasized by MIT research showing 95% of AI applications fail. From my experience over the past three years—I wasn't initially an AI expert, but I've done extensive implementation work—I always start with end-game thinking.\n\nThe end game is this: all companies will have access to the same AI models—GPT, OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, whatever. How will you compete when everyone has the same technology?\n\nWhen we launch this thinking experiment with companies, most reach the same conclusion: it's not about large language models or AI products. It's about how to leverage AI as a tool in your organization and who are the talents who can help your company better use AI to grow business.\"\n\n### The Golden Rules: Start Small, Show Value, Build Momentum\n\n\"When entrepreneurs see that AI can be everywhere but have limited budgets, they ask: where should I start?\n\nI follow golden rules based on experience with clients:\n\n**For small to medium companies unfamiliar with AI:**\n\n1. **Start small** - Do something people can use, touch, feel, and gain experience from\n2. **Demonstrate value quickly** - Let people see tangible AI benefits\n3. **Build momentum for scaling** - Start step-by-step, then accelerate implementation\n\nThis creates the adoption curve I see with most companies. What to avoid: starting very big and failing the project. That's exactly why 95% of AI projects fail—companies want to transform everything with AI but get neither quick experience nor quick value, losing momentum.\n\n**Successful examples:**\n\n* Manufacturing client solving specific production forecasting: when/how supply chains could be disrupted\n* Retailer picking one single product for AI-empowered marketing\n\nBoth gained value and experience quickly, learning to scale effectively.\"\n\n### Rethinking ROI: Automation + Upskilling Formula\n\n\"Companies often ask about ROI with traditional revenue/investment analysis. I provide a different thinking angle:\n\nDon't think about **replacing human beings**—think about **automating repetitive work** while **upskilling employees for higher-value tasks.**\n\nExample: Someone scanning papers five hours daily. We use simple OCR to automate this process, then transfer that time to higher-value work. Our ROI analysis becomes smoother because we're not calculating uncertain AI revenue benefits, but clear efficiency gains plus human capital development.\n\nTake Harvey AI—famous in the US for continuously raising money—they focus on verticalized, repetitive jobs for lawyers in private equity markets. Limited investment, clear value, scalable impact.\"\n\n### The Tool-First Approach: Leverage Existing Platforms\n\n\"Don't try to buy NVIDIA cards or train custom models unless absolutely necessary. Leverage existing tools:\n\n**AI Agents:** Think of OpenAI as their brain with hands—they can browse websites, create presentations, execute tasks. It's accessible through applications.\n\n**Code Platforms:** Different from simple Q&A. You want question 1, question 2, question 3 with specific logic to get answers you're 100% confident about. Code platforms offer mini-blocks like Lego—each plug-in handles one job/task previously done by humans. Lines between blocks create your workflow, giving better outcome control and answer quality.\"\n\n### The Human-Centric Transformation Imperative\n\n\"Here's a joke from the Olympics: on the left, someone empowered by AI tools and advanced technology. On the right, someone very chill with nothing. Having advanced technology doesn't guarantee winning—just like having Olympic equipment doesn't guarantee medals.\n\n**Cultural change is essential.** Put human beings at the center of AI transformation. Support them, help them, upskill them. Most people had zero AI knowledge before ChatGPT, so we must accompany employees through cultural change.\n\nOtherwise, you'll have AI products on one side while your finance team still exchanges Excel files by email—exactly the low ROI case you want to avoid.\"\n\n### Tomorrow's Competitive Advantage Formula\n\n\"Tomorrow's company competitiveness includes AI technology, but more importantly:\n\n* **AI implementation efficiency**\n* **AI organization and use cases**\n* **AI talents**\n\nIt's always the traditional organizational fundamentals. Human employees remain at the organization's center—this is a no-brainer. Start small, keep an eye on cultural change, and ensure you're always upskilling teams with best knowledge, resources, and talents to grow with the company and get empowered by AI to create more revenue.\"\n\n### Practical Implementation Checklist\n\n\"I've prepared a document: 'AI Enterprise Implementation: Five Do's and Five Don'ts'—available for free download via LinkedIn. It covers practical steps for getting started without common pitfalls.\n\nRemember: having access to AI models is just the beginning. Your competitive advantage comes from how efficiently you implement, how well you organize use cases, and how effectively you develop AI-capable talent.\"\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Successful AI implementation isn't about the technology—it's about implementation efficiency, organizational readiness, and putting humans at the center of transformation.\n\n## Part III: Real-World Application - AI in Executive Search\n\n**Kevin Hong, Partner at LYC Partners and Co-founder of DEX AI**\n\n### The Paradox Question: AI in Human-Centric Work\n\n\"Thank you, Ainara. The main question people ask is: why invest in AI for recruiting when so many say artificial intelligence can't replace human judgment in hiring?\n\nThis is an interesting case study of what Alex mentioned about starting small and different mindsets for getting ROI from AI. Let me provide context on how someone can be both in executive search and developing AI tools for business.\n\nI started my career as a functional IT tech consultant for IBM and Capgemini—not really into IT, but translating technical requirements into business workflows. Moving into professional services with labor-intensive requirements, it was always about efficiency: how do I make processes more productive?\n\nIn executive search, we earn money by making people more productive. We went through strong demand changes, and our consultants—used to relationship building, networking, knowing people—were suddenly competing against digital platforms like LinkedIn. People expected faster and faster results.\"\n\n### The 70% Problem: High-Value People, Low-Value Tasks\n\n\"What happened was counterintuitive. Our strongest consultants—people who could meet with C-suites—were spending 70% of their time scrolling LinkedIn, competing with people who just scroll the internet.\n\nThis didn't make sense. People who can talk to C-suites shouldn't spend most of their time on LinkedIn. With digital tools, culture changed: consultants spent more time in offices looking at computers, becoming less engaging and losing our competitive edge against competitors we didn't want to compete with.\n\nThe question became: what in their processes could be automated or outsourced?\"\n\n### The Segmentation Strategy: Workflows Before AI\n\n\"Five years ago, we started with more interns and fresh graduates doing lower-level work. We segmented processes, and when AI emerged—inefficient as it was initially—we were ready to plug things into AI because we had:\n\n* **Segmented entire processes**\n* **Segmented workflows**\n* **Clear decisions on what could use AI vs. what shouldn't**\n\nBasically, anything done by interns or fresh graduates could be done by AI. Fifteen years ago at IBM, this work was outsourced to India, Pakistan, or Philippines. In my company, it started going to AI for low-value, repetitive, administrative tasks.\n\nThree years ago, at ChatGPT's first launch, AI was slowly improving. We had pilot use cases and were ready to scale when the team asked the crucial question.\"\n\n### The Trust Crisis and Team Alignment\n\n\"During a training presentation on what AI was doing, someone asked: 'You are replacing us.' I was so excited about new tools that I hadn't thought this through.\n\nThis forced us to build together with the team—not just starting small, but thinking about scale-out vision. We had to break down what AI should do versus what humans should do, focusing on what makes human capabilities irreplaceable in our practice.\n\n**The conclusion:**\n\n* **Humans handle judgments and relationships** - AI augments the team as a tool\n* **Assess and upskill teams** on what they should add value to business\n* **Go full implementation on AI** for appropriate tasks\n\nWe created 'AI versus human' tests for one year to push the team toward more human-centric work: relationships, trust, better prioritization, judgment, and decision-making.\"\n\n### The Six-Month Revelation: AI Outperforms Humans\n\n\"For the machine/AI side, we tested: can you compete with the team on sourcing candidates? Can you get shortlists faster with better quality?\n\n**Spoiler alert:** After six months, AI performed better than the team. Maybe our team wasn't the market's best for this type of task, but AI became officially a tool for the team to use, selling to clients with no choice but to upskill.\n\n**Our process now covers:**\n\n* Understanding job requirements\n* Searching multiple databases including our own\n* Screening and ranking candidates\n* Generating shortlists\n* Generating contact information\n* Presenting shortlists with candidate interest levels\n\n**Result:** Within 24 hours (now just a few hours), clients have full candidate lists presented first to our team/managers, then to clients.\"\n\n### The KPI Revolution: From Quantity to Quality\n\n\"We had to change how we assess teams since old KPIs were no longer relevant:\n\n**Old KPIs (quantity-focused):**\n\n* How many CVs screened\n* Number of outreaches\n* Hours spent searching databases\n\n**New KPIs (quality-focused):**\n\n* Client satisfaction\n* Project management effectiveness\n* Prioritization quality\n* Recurring business generation from candidates and clients\n\nMore focus on human-centric value—more difficult to measure but more beautiful work.\n\n**The paradox:** The more we implemented AI, the more human our team became, requiring more human-centric assessment of work quality.\"\n\n### The Commercial Success: AI Tool + Human Expertise\n\n\"We're now fully launching and commercializing our separate AI tool to clients who use it directly, while our team upgrades service delivery for:\n\n* **Human judgment screening**\n* **Network and relationship building**\n* **Personality and culture fit assessment**\n* **Leadership assessment**\n\nClients now see more value in headhunting and executive search services than one or two years ago. They use our AI products, reach certain limits with frustration, then realize: 'I need someone to talk to right now. I cannot just rely on a machine.'\n\nThis was exactly what we aimed for from the beginning.\"\n\n### Strategic Implementation Lessons\n\n\"Key lessons from our experience:\n\n1. **It's not about cost or direct revenue** - It's about strategic change and organizational approach\n2. **Segment workflows first** - Understand processes before implementing AI\n3. **Address team concerns directly** - Build vision together, not just pilot projects\n4. **Change KPIs to match new reality** - Measure what actually matters in AI-augmented work\n5. **Use AI to enhance human value** - Don't replace humans; make their work more strategic\n\nThe real investment people need to make is strategic change and team approach to fully seize AI opportunities.\"\n\n**Key Takeaway:** AI doesn't replace human judgment—it frees humans to focus on what they do best while automating repetitive tasks, creating better client outcomes and more fulfilling work.\n\n## Workshop Q&A: Practical Applications and Deep Dives\n\n### Question 1: Balancing Innovation Speed with Regulatory Compliance\n\n**Moderator Question:** \"How do you balance innovation speed with regulatory compliance, especially when regulations are still evolving?\"\n\n**Benoit's Response:** \"Excellent question—you cannot wait, and I'll explain why from aerospace experience. Every drone industry struggled because technology changes monthly while airplane certification processes take years.\n\nYou freeze design, go through certification, which makes it crucial to work with regulators and engage in drafting processes. Any sentence can be framed a thousand ways, and depending on framing, it either closes or opens solution possibilities.\n\nIn AI where solution possibilities explode, navigate this fine line by understanding mindsets of people you're talking to, not just what's on paper. If you wait for things on paper, you lose the battle. You must be ahead.\n\nAs other speakers reflected: do it as you go. Fly the airplane and fix the engine—you can't stop flying because the engine's on fire. You need both, and it's complex, but it's the only way I see success.\"\n\n**Alex's China Perspective:** \"In mainland China, regulation isn't as strict as EU. The mindset is: first, do technology innovations. Afterward, see what it brings to society and employees, then correct and iterate.\n\nIs this right? Maybe, but I always stand on protecting human beings—privacy, client data protection. Long-term, those respecting regulations will win markets. But currently, the market situation isn't structured, so lots of competition happens. Honestly, in mainland China, regulation isn't top-of-mind for executives.\"\n\n**Kevin's Entrepreneurial View:** \"There's a big difference between Chinese and European ecosystems. I lean toward the Chinese approach for one reason: it's more entrepreneurial—test and trial, do it and figure it out later.\n\nThis happened with internet technology histo\n\nrically. I felt comfortable embracing new technology in my traditionally conservative practice. Try it, figure it out, add value, generate changes and innovation. When you reach struggles with markets, prices, technology, or regulation, add protective layers around privacy when you launch.\"\n\n### Question 2: Starting AI Implementation in Large Organizations\n\n**Participant Question:** \"For large organizations with complex hierarchies, how do you recommend starting AI implementation when there's resistance to change?\"\n\n**Alex's Framework Response:** \"Start with the 'pilot department' approach. Identify one department or business unit with:\n\n* **Clear pain points** that AI can address\n* **Supportive leadership** willing to experiment\n* **Measurable outcomes** that can demonstrate value\n\nOnce you have success in one area, use that as proof of concept for other departments. Internal success stories are more powerful than external case studies for overcoming resistance.\n\n**Cultural change strategies:**\n\n* **Include skeptics in pilot selection** - make them part of solution development\n* **Provide extensive training** - fear often comes from unfamiliarity\n* **Show, don't tell** - demonstrations work better than presentations\n* **Celebrate early wins loudly** - build momentum through visible successes\"\n\n**Kevin's Scaling Experience:** \"From our experience scaling across teams, the key is 'voluntary adoption first.' We made AI tools available but didn't mandate usage. Team members who saw colleagues getting better results naturally wanted access.\n\nThe competitive element worked well—nobody wanted to be less efficient than their peers. Once adoption reached critical mass (about 60% of team), it became the new standard and holdouts joined quickly.\"\n\n### Question 3: Measuring AI ROI in Practice\n\n**Participant Question:** \"What specific metrics do you recommend for measuring AI implementation success?\"\n\n**Alex's Metric Framework:**\n\n**Efficiency Metrics:**\n\n* Time reduction for specific tasks (before/after AI)\n* Error reduction rates\n* Process automation percentages\n\n**Value Creation Metrics:**\n\n* Revenue increase from AI-enabled activities\n* Cost reduction from process improvements\n* Customer satisfaction improvements\n\n**Adoption Metrics:**\n\n* User engagement with AI tools\n* Training completion rates\n* Process compliance improvements\n\n**Strategic Metrics:**\n\n* Speed of decision-making\n* Innovation project completion rates\n* Competitive advantage indicators\n\n**Kevin's Real-World Metrics:**\n\n\"We track both quantitative and qualitative measures:\n\n**Quantitative:**\n\n* Time-to-shortlist: reduced from 2 weeks to 24 hours\n* Candidate quality scores: improved 40% based on client feedback\n* Team utilization: 70% more time on high-value activities\n\n**Qualitative:**\n\n* Client satisfaction surveys\n* Team engagement scores\n* Quality of candidate relationships\n* Depth of client strategic conversations\n\nThe paradox is that our most important metrics became harder to measure but more valuable to track.\"\n\n### Question 4: Common AI Implementation Failures\n\n**Moderator Question:** \"What are the most common reasons AI implementations fail, and how can organizations avoid them?\"\n\n**Alex's Top 5 Failure Patterns:**\n\n1. **Starting too big** - Trying to transform everything at once\n2. **Technology focus without process design** - Implementing AI before understanding workflows\n3. **Ignoring cultural change** - Not preparing teams for new ways of working\n4. **Unrealistic expectations** - Expecting immediate, dramatic results\n5. **Lack of ongoing support** - Treating implementation as one-time project vs. ongoing evolution\n\n**Prevention strategies:**\n\n* Start with pilot projects in controlled environments\n* Invest heavily in change management and training\n* Set realistic timelines and expectations\n* Plan for continuous iteration and improvement\n* Measure both technical and adoption metrics\n\n**Benoit's Governance Perspective:** \"Many failures stem from regulatory blind spots. Organizations implement AI without considering compliance requirements, then face costly retrofitting or complete restarts.\n\nBuild governance into initial design, not as an afterthought. This prevents the most expensive type of failure—successful technology implementation that can't be deployed due to regulatory issues.\"\n\n**Kevin's Human Factor Insights:** \"The biggest failure I see is treating AI implementation as a technology project instead of a business transformation project.\n\nSuccessful implementations focus on:\n\n* **How work will change** - not just what technology will do\n* **How people will adapt** - not just what systems will automate\n* **How value will be created** - not just what processes will be improved\n\nWhen you focus on business outcomes instead of technical capabilities, implementation success rates increase dramatically.\"\n\n## Key Takeaways: The New AI Success Formula\n\n### The 90%/10% Rule: Implementation Over Technology\n\nWith AI technology becoming commoditized, competitive advantage comes 90% from implementation excellence and only 10% from technology selection. Organizations must prioritize governance, strategy, and cultural transformation over technology acquisition.\n\n### The Governance-First Advantage\n\nCompanies that treat AI governance as competitive advantage rather than compliance burden create sustainable market positions. Regulatory compliance becomes a moat that competitors struggle to cross, especially in global markets.\n\n### The Human-AI Symbiosis Success Pattern\n\nThe most successful AI implementations don't replace human capabilities—they amplify them. Organizations that focus on human-AI collaboration rather than human-AI replacement achieve better results and stronger team adoption.\n\n### The Start Small, Scale Smart Philosophy\n\nBeginning with focused pilots that deliver clear value and building systematically outperforms large-scale transformation attempts. Success comes from learning quickly and scaling systematically, not from big-bang implementations.\n\n### The Cultural Transformation Imperative\n\nAI success requires cultural change, not just technological change. Organizations that invest as heavily in change management and team development as they do in technology achieve higher adoption rates and better results.\n\n### The Strategic Integration Advantage\n\nAI implementations that align with broader business strategy and create reinforcing competitive advantages sustain success longer than point solutions. Integration across governance, strategy, and operations multiplies AI value creation.\n\n## Conclusion: From AI Experimentation to AI Excellence\n\nThis workshop demonstrated that AI implementation success depends more on strategic thinking and execution excellence than on technological sophistication. The companies quietly achieving results are those asking tough questions about governance, starting with focused implementations, and putting cultural transformation at the center of their AI strategies.\n\nThe evidence is clear: organizations that master all three pillars—governance as competitive advantage, strategic implementation frameworks, and human-centered applications—position themselves not just to survive AI disruption, but to lead their industries through it.\n\n**The Future Belongs to AI-Excellent Organizations:** Those that combine regulatory sophistication, implementation efficiency, and cultural transformation will create sustainable competitive advantages that become increasingly difficult for competitors to match.\n\n**Final Call to Action:** Your AI journey starts with a single question: Will you treat AI as a technology project or a business transformation? The companies that choose transformation—with proper governance, strategic implementation, and human-centered design—will define the competitive landscape for the next decade.\n\nThe time for AI excellence is now. The frameworks exist. The tools are available. The question is: Will you build bridges to the future, or will you be left behind by those who do?\n\n*For implementation support, governance consulting, or strategic planning assistance with any of our frameworks discussed today, please connect with the speakers through LYC Partners. Complete workshop recordings, implementation checklists, and additional resources are available to all participants.*\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n[See All](https://www.lyc-partners.ai/resources)\n\n[The Power of Executive Peer Networks (and How to Actually Leverage Them)](https://www.lyc-partners.ai/post/the-power-of-executive-peer-networks-and-how-to-actually-leverage-them)\n\n[Ask Me Anything: Career Anxiety, Leadership Skills, and Executive Growth](https://www.lyc-partners.ai/post/ask-me-anything-career-anxiety-leadership-skills-and-executive-growth)\n\n[The Industry Map That Changed My Career (and How It Can Change Yours)](https://www.lyc-partners.ai/post/the-industry-map-that-changed-my-career-and-how-it-can-change-yours)\n\nbottom of page\n\n "

Rightly so, when it comes to the core elements of the legal workflow – researching case law, pouring over documents to find the needles in the haystack, and drafting standardized documents like contracts, policies, and discovery requests – the agentic and generative AI (GenAI) solutions available today are helping firms cover more ground faster and more comprehensively than ever before possible.\n\nNearly half (47%) of law firm respondents from the [Future of Professionals Report](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/future-of-professionals-action-plan-law-firms-2025/) say their firms are already experiencing at least one type of benefit from AI adoption and 80% expect AI to fundamentally alter the course of their business over the next five years. Chief among those is time savings. On average, law firm professionals expect to free up 190 hours per year by using AI. At current average hourly rates, that works out to approximately $18,000 in savings per professional, per year – or a total of $20 billion for the U.S. legal industry.\n\n**Perception vs. Reality**\n\nFor all the enthusiasm that exists for AI’s potential, however, there is a large gap emerging between law firms’ AI aspirations and their real-world AI strategies. Even though the majority of law firms expect AI to drive transformational change in the future and nearly half are experiencing some benefits now, far fewer (29%) expect to see high or transformational levels of change this year. When pressed further on what their firms are doing today to leverage AI, nearly one-third (32%) of law firm respondents say they feel their firms are moving too slowly on AI adoption, and just 22% say their firms have a visible AI strategy in place.\n\nThis gap between future ideals and current realities is a phenomenon [McKinsey recently dubbed](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage#/) “the GenAI paradox,” which occurs when businesses race to invest in AI pilot projects and buy new solutions, but struggle when it comes to implementing them and integrating them into everyday workflows. Versions of this struggle are playing out in virtually every industry right now as professionals come to grips with the fact that true transformation is not as simple as plugging in an off-the-shelf AI tool. It requires a clear strategy, a carefully planned roadmap, targeted integration of professional-grade AI solutions, and a commitment at all levels for the long haul. A firm cannot afford to sit on the sidelines any longer – it is imperative to have an AI strategy.\n\n**Key Steps to True AI Transformation**\n\nOver the course of our partnerships helping some of the world’s largest law firms not only access new AI capabilities, but [implement firm-wide AI strategies](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/reports/future-of-professionals-report-2025-actionable-insights-for-law-firm-leaders/form?gatedContent=%252Fcontent%252Fewp-marketing-websites%252Flegal%252Fgl%252Fen%252Finsights%252Freports%252Ffuture-of-professionals-report-2025-actionable-insights-for-law-firm-leaders), we’ve found four levers that all firms need to engage to ensure the success of their AI initiatives.\n\nWhile the detailed strategies and specific paths to AI implementation will vary from firm to firm, there are a handful of universal truths that apply to all. Foremost is the commitment to address the AI revolution for what it really is – a monumental transformation in the way legal work is conducted on par with the introduction of the personal computer, the internet, and the smartphone. It is not enough just to buy the latest greatest widget. Firms that want to extract real value from AI need to think hard about how it will affect everything they do and start addressing those changes now to unlock the full potential of the technology to transform their firm.\n\n### Share\n\n## Read more about **Innovation**\n\n![](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/09/243484_136592548.jpeg-370x208.jpg)\n\n### **From Testcase to Trust: Benchmarking CoCounsel with Scorecard**\n\n![](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/08/shutterstock_635690486-370x208.jpg)\n\n### **CoCounsel Monthly Insider: Sharpening Your Competitive Edge**\n\nSeptember 2025\n\n![](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/09/249655_395558369-370x208.jpg)\n\n### **Don’t Mistake Advancements for Improvement: Lessons from GPT5’s Rollback**"

With a significant majority of companies now integrating AI into their operations and the global AI market poised for rapid expansion, the focus is shifting from *if* to *how* to adopt AI safely and effectively [3]. While initial data suggest a stable labor market without an immediate \"AI jobs apocalypse\"—with AI's early workplace impacts comparable to previous technological shifts like the internet and computers [2]—proactive risk management remains paramount.\n\nA fundamental aspect of safe AI adoption is **visibility**. As the adage goes, \"You can't protect what you can't see\" [1]. This necessitates a comprehensive understanding of all AI systems within your organization, including their functionality, data interactions, and outputs. Robust data governance, incorporating measures like encryption, anonymization, and stringent access controls, is crucial to prevent data leaks and protect sensitive information during AI training and prompting [5]. Adhering to frameworks such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework can help balance innovation with ethical and responsible development [3].\n\nBeyond data, securing the entire AI lifecycle is vital. This means protecting AI models themselves from manipulation or extraction of sensitive data through techniques like model encryption [5]. APIs, often gateways for AI models, require careful scoping to minimum datasets and additional safety checks to guard against potential attack vectors [5]. Furthermore, ensure the AI supply chain is secure, enabling your business to identify and manage unique vulnerabilities and deploy applications with a \"secure-by-design\" mindset [5].\n\nSmall businesses must also contend with AI-specific \"misfires.\" Generative AI models can \"hallucinate,\" producing false or misleading content that could harm your brand, particularly in customer-facing applications [5]. Thoroughly testing response accuracy, implementing layered validation, and establishing feedback loops for model refinement are crucial [5]. Ethical considerations extend to copyright concerns; ensure your AI systems are trained on properly licensed data and verify your AI partners adhere to ethical standards [5]. Employee training is also essential to prevent the inadvertent exposure of intellectual property to AI tools, and to equip staff to recognize and mitigate \"jailbreaking\" attempts that bypass safety protocols [5].\n\nFinally, successful AI integration requires strategic planning and investment in your workforce. Many organizations face hurdles such as a lack of skilled professionals, significant upfront costs, and challenges integrating AI with existing legacy systems [3]. Instead of rushing to adopt every new tool, a phased rollout focusing on clear business objectives and how AI augments human capabilities can ease transitions [4, 3]. By investing in AI literacy and specialized training, small businesses can cultivate the internal expertise needed to navigate this evolving landscape and harness AI's potential for sustainable, long-term growth [3].\n\n---\n**Sources**\n[1] The 5 Golden Rules of Safe AI Adoption — [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-golden-rules-safe-ai-adoption-indian-cyber-security-solutions-xfgvf](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-golden-rules-safe-ai-adoption-indian-cyber-security-solutions-xfgvf)\n[2] New data show no AI jobs apocalypse—for now — [https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-data-show-no-ai-jobs-apocalypse-for-now/](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-data-show-no-ai-jobs-apocalypse-for-now/)\n[3] AI Adoption Rates by Industry: Trends 2025 — [https://www.mezzi.com/blog/ai-adoption-rates-by-industry-trends-2025](https://www.mezzi.com/blog/ai-adoption-rates-by-industry-trends-2025)\n[4] 2025 AI Adoption Across Industries: Trends You Don't Want ... — [https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/ai-adoption-trends-you-should-not-miss-2025)\n[5] 20 Expert Tips For Effective And Secure Enterprise AI Adoption — [https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/04/19/20-expert-tips-for-effective-and-secure-enterprise-ai-adoption/](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/04/19/20-expert-tips-for-effective-and-secure-enterprise-ai-adoption/)"

          "output": "## Accessing AI Tools for Your Small Business\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving beyond science fiction, offering a robust suite of tools that can act as personal assistants for small businesses, boosting efficiency and fostering innovation [1]. Many of these powerful AI solutions are either free or available through \"freemium\" plans, making them accessible for businesses looking to experiment and integrate AI into their daily operations [1], [3].\n\nFor general assistance and quick insights, **AI chatbots** are a primary entry point. Tools like **ChatGPT**, **Google Gemini**, **Claude**, **Microsoft Copilot**, **Perplexity**, and **Pi** can handle a wide range of conversational tasks. They can answer complex questions, summarize articles, brainstorm ideas, generate text, and even help with web browsing [1], [3]. Perplexity notably distinguishes itself by citing its sources, allowing for easy verification of information [1].\n\nContent creation, a significant need for small businesses, is also streamlined by AI. For **writing**, tools like **Copy.ai**, **Rytr**, **Quillbot**, and **Grammarly** can generate blog headlines, emails, social media content, and web copy, as well as rephrase text, summarize, and ensure mistake-free writing [1], [3]. In **visual and design**, platforms such as **Canva Magic Studio**, **Adobe Express with Firefly**, **Ideogram**, and **Microsoft Designer** empower users to create custom images, text effects, and professional-quality graphics using simple text prompts or existing ideas [1], [3].\n\nBeyond text and images, AI extends to **video and audio**. **Synthesia** allows businesses to generate realistic AI human avatar videos for training modules or presentations, translating text into video without the need for cameras or studios [3]. **Suno** can generate original, royalty-free background music from text prompts [1], [3], while **ElevenLabs** excels in natural-sounding AI voice generation and cloning [3]. For social media content, **OpusClip** efficiently breaks longer videos into short, shareable, captioned clips [3].\n\nTo enhance **productivity and automation**, several AI tools stand out. For meetings, **Fathom** and **Nyota** act as AI notetakers, recording conversations, tracking speakers, and generating structured summaries, with Nyota even automating follow-up tasks and CRM updates [3]. For **research and knowledge management**, **NotebookLM** and **Deep Research** can synthesize vast amounts of information from uploaded documents and online sources into comprehensive reports and even audio summaries [3], [4]. Automation platforms like **n8n** and **Manus** help automate repetitive tasks by connecting various apps and services into visual workflows [3]. Even **scheduling** benefits from AI, with tools like **Reclaim** and **Clockwise** optimizing calendars by managing tasks, meetings, and protecting focus time [3].\n\nAI also supports specialized business functions. Human Resources departments can leverage general AI assistants for drafting onboarding strategies, brainstorming employee engagement ideas, or even assisting with conflict resolution [2]. Marketing and sales teams benefit from tools like **AdCreative** for generating ad creatives, **AirOps** for scalable content operations, and **Attio** as an AI-powered CRM [3].\n\nWhen exploring these tools, small business leaders should remember that many offer free tiers or trials, allowing for experimentation before commitment. However, it's crucial to consider ethical use, transparently attribute AI-generated content, and be mindful of data privacy, as free versions may not always privatize user data [3], [5].\n\n### Sources\n\n[1] 40 AI tools for teachers, educators and classrooms (free and paid) — ditchthattextbook.com\n[2] What AI tools are you using and what are you using it for?

          "output": "## Strategic AI Implementation\n\nStrategic AI implementation is about more than simply adopting new technology; it’s a deliberate framework that aligns Artificial Intelligence with your core business objectives while effectively managing associated risks [2]. For small businesses, this approach is crucial for scaling operations, transforming processes, and securing a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market [1].\n\nAI offers a range of tangible benefits that can significantly impact your bottom line. Automation of routine and repetitive tasks is a primary advantage, reducing human error, lowering labor costs, and freeing your valuable employees to concentrate on more strategic, high-value initiatives [1, 4]. Customer experience can be greatly enhanced through AI technologies like chatbots and virtual assistants, providing 24/7 support, boosting satisfaction, and fostering loyalty through personalized interactions based on customer behavior and preferences [1]. Furthermore, AI can streamline supply chain management by enabling more accurate demand prediction, optimizing inventory levels, and improving logistics efficiency, which in turn reduces waste, costs, and ensures timely product delivery. Beyond these efficiencies, AI fosters innovation, allowing businesses to rapidly experiment with new models and iterate on products or services, providing essential agility for growth [1].\n\nHowever, the journey to AI implementation comes with its own set of challenges. Small businesses frequently encounter hurdles such as high initial costs, data privacy concerns, and a general lack of skilled personnel [1]. Data quality and availability are often significant roadblocks, necessitating a thorough evaluation of existing data sources and proactive efforts to address gaps before any model development can begin [2, 3]. Skills gaps and talent shortages across data science, engineering, and business domains are common, potentially leading to an overreliance on outsourcing if internal capabilities aren't cultivated [2, 3]. Integrating AI with outdated legacy IT systems can also prove complex and resource-intensive, consuming more resources than anticipated [2, 3]. Demonstrating a clear Return on Investment (ROI) is another struggle, as organizations often find it difficult to quantify AI's value beyond mere technical metrics [2, 3]. Finally, risk aversion and unrealistic expectations—driven by hype or fear of failure—can hinder adoption, especially if early pilots don't deliver immediate, dramatic results [3, 4].\n\nTo successfully navigate these challenges, small businesses should adopt a strategic roadmap focusing on practical steps. Begin by starting small, identifying one or two high-impact use cases where AI can deliver immediate, demonstrable value [2, 4]. This approach builds crucial momentum for scaling. Rethink ROI beyond just direct revenue; focus on automating repetitive work and simultaneously upskilling employees for higher-value tasks, calculating gains in efficiency and human capital development [4]. Instead of costly custom model training or infrastructure investments, leverage existing AI platforms and tools, such as AI agents or code platforms, that offer accessible solutions [4]. Crucially, place your human workforce at the center of your AI transformation. Foster cultural change, provide extensive training, and clearly demonstrate how AI empowers employees to undertake more strategic, fulfilling work [4]. Integrating governance into your initial design is paramount, ensuring compliance from the outset and preventing costly retrofitting down the line [4]. By prioritizing focused initiatives and a human-centric approach, small businesses can effectively transition from AI experimentation to sustainable, value-driven implementation [2].\n\n---\n**Sources**\n\n[1] Scaling Operations: The Benefits of Strategic AI Implementation — theapexintelligence.com\n[2] AI Implementation Roadmap: 6-Phase Guide for 2025 — spaceo.ai\n[3] Implementation challenges that hinder the strategic use of AI in ... — oecd.org\n[4] AI Implementation: Governance, Strategy, and Practical Applications — lyc-partners.ai"

For **writing**, tools like **Copy.ai**, **Rytr**, **Quillbot**, and **Grammarly** can generate blog headlines, emails, social media content, and web copy, as well as rephrase text, summarize, and ensure mistake-free writing [1], [3]. In **visual and design**, platforms such as **Canva Magic Studio**, **Adobe Express with Firefly**, **Ideogram**, and **Microsoft Designer** empower users to create custom images, text effects, and professional-quality graphics using simple text prompts or existing ideas [1], [3].\n\nBeyond text and images, AI extends to **video and audio**. **Synthesia** allows businesses to generate realistic AI human avatar videos for training modules or presentations, translating text into video without the need for cameras or studios [3]. **Suno** can generate original, royalty-free background music from text prompts [1], [3], while **ElevenLabs** excels in natural-sounding AI voice generation and cloning [3]. For social media content, **OpusClip** efficiently breaks longer videos into short, shareable, captioned clips [3].\n\nTo enhance **productivity and automation**, several AI tools stand out. For meetings, **Fathom** and **Nyota** act as AI notetakers, recording conversations, tracking speakers, and generating structured summaries, with Nyota even automating follow-up tasks and CRM updates [3]. For **research and knowledge management**, **NotebookLM** and **Deep Research** can synthesize vast amounts of information from uploaded documents and online sources into comprehensive reports and even audio summaries [3], [4]. Automation platforms like **n8n** and **Manus** help automate repetitive tasks by connecting various apps and services into visual workflows [3]. Even **scheduling** benefits from AI, with tools like **Reclaim** and **Clockwise** optimizing calendars by managing tasks, meetings, and protecting focus time [3].\n\nAI also supports specialized business functions. Human Resources departments can leverage general AI assistants for drafting onboarding strategies, brainstorming employee engagement ideas, or even assisting with conflict resolution [2]. Marketing and sales teams benefit from tools like **AdCreative** for generating ad creatives, **AirOps** for scalable content operations, and **Attio** as an AI-powered CRM [3].\n\nWhen exploring these tools, small business leaders should remember that many offer free tiers or trials, allowing for experimentation before commitment. However, it's crucial to consider ethical use, transparently attribute AI-generated content, and be mindful of data privacy, as free versions may not always privatize user data [3], [5].\n\n### Sources\n\n[1] 40 AI tools for teachers, educators and classrooms (free and paid) — ditchthattextbook.com\n[2] What AI tools are you using and what are you using it for?

            "## Strategic AI Implementation\n\nStrategic AI implementation is about more than simply adopting new technology; it’s a deliberate framework that aligns Artificial Intelligence with your core business objectives while effectively managing associated risks [2]. For small businesses, this approach is crucial for scaling operations, transforming processes, and securing a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market [1].\n\nAI offers a range of tangible benefits that can significantly impact your bottom line. Automation of routine and repetitive tasks is a primary advantage, reducing human error, lowering labor costs, and freeing your valuable employees to concentrate on more strategic, high-value initiatives [1, 4]. Customer experience can be greatly enhanced through AI technologies like chatbots and virtual assistants, providing 24/7 support, boosting satisfaction, and fostering loyalty through personalized interactions based on customer behavior and preferences [1]. Furthermore, AI can streamline supply chain management by enabling more accurate demand prediction, optimizing inventory levels, and improving logistics efficiency, which in turn reduces waste, costs, and ensures timely product delivery. Beyond these efficiencies, AI fosters innovation, allowing businesses to rapidly experiment with new models and iterate on products or services, providing essential agility for growth [1].\n\nHowever, the journey to AI implementation comes with its own set of challenges. Small businesses frequently encounter hurdles such as high initial costs, data privacy concerns, and a general lack of skilled personnel [1]. Data quality and availability are often significant roadblocks, necessitating a thorough evaluation of existing data sources and proactive efforts to address gaps before any model development can begin [2, 3]. Skills gaps and talent shortages across data science, engineering, and business domains are common, potentially leading to an overreliance on outsourcing if internal capabilities aren't cultivated [2, 3]. Integrating AI with outdated legacy IT systems can also prove complex and resource-intensive, consuming more resources than anticipated [2, 3]. Demonstrating a clear Return on Investment (ROI) is another struggle, as organizations often find it difficult to quantify AI's value beyond mere technical metrics [2, 3]. Finally, risk aversion and unrealistic expectations—driven by hype or fear of failure—can hinder adoption, especially if early pilots don't deliver immediate, dramatic results [3, 4].\n\nTo successfully navigate these challenges, small businesses should adopt a strategic roadmap focusing on practical steps. Begin by starting small, identifying one or two high-impact use cases where AI can deliver immediate, demonstrable value [2, 4]. This approach builds crucial momentum for scaling. Rethink ROI beyond just direct revenue; focus on automating repetitive work and simultaneously upskilling employees for higher-value tasks, calculating gains in efficiency and human capital development [4]. Instead of costly custom model training or infrastructure investments, leverage existing AI platforms and tools, such as AI agents or code platforms, that offer accessible solutions [4]. Crucially, place your human workforce at the center of your AI transformation. Foster cultural change, provide extensive training, and clearly demonstrate how AI empowers employees to undertake more strategic, fulfilling work [4]. Integrating governance into your initial design is paramount, ensuring compliance from the outset and preventing costly retrofitting down the line [4]. By prioritizing focused initiatives and a human-centric approach, small businesses can effectively transition from AI experimentation to sustainable, value-driven implementation [2].\n\n---\n**Sources**\n\n[1] Scaling Operations: The Benefits of Strategic AI Implementation — theapexintelligence.com\n[2] AI Implementation Roadmap: 6-Phase Guide for 2025 — spaceo.ai\n[3] Implementation challenges that hinder the strategic use of AI in ... — oecd.org\n[4] AI Implementation: Governance, Strategy, and Practical Applications — lyc-partners.ai"
